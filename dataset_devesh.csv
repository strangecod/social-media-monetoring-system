Vaishakhi told me about her journey of starting out working mostly nights, and really thriving as she learned about how we deliver packages to customers. A few months into her role, Vaishakhi found a mentor in TEB9 Senior Operations Manager, Jessie Bixby, and six months later was promoted to Process Assistant. But the story doesn’t end here. Thanks to Amazon's Career Choice program, which offers employees pre-paid education and skills training, Vaishakhi has started working toward a college degree (majoring in Business Administration) and is also taking ESL classes to help improve her English.

Today, I can proudly say I was a part of that journey where the company grew to 30 people and 6 products today. It was an insane ride filled with its ups and downs. Special thanks to Chinmay Jindal & Ankit Mishra, for being the best people to work for & with, and keep me all motivated and running through these years. The trust and faith they showed in a newly graduated guy was immense and I did everything in my power to keep that intact. Another person I would highly appreciate is Varanasi Shashank, he was one of the best colleagues to work with. Always standing by the side, fuel to my engine, and help me motor the ideas and products throughout these years. Special thanks to Virendra Pratap, Jibin Joseph, Aman Kumar, Tamana M., Kashish Behl, Himanshu Kumar Das, Sameen Ahmad, Dhawal Singh P., Aradhya Trivedi, Yash Panchal, Jeel Bhavsar, Prateek Chouhan and many others who have over the years supported and encouraged me throughout my time with the company. I will always be very grateful to you guys for being there in this journey and giving me the lifetime of experiences.StoryXpress taught me a lot of things, one of those is ""Things can go to ashes, but never lose the trust in you, if you trust yourself everything can get right back"". I wish all the very best to the team at StoryXpress to do wonders and keep breaking those barriers. You will be very close to my heart. :)To the new beginning!!  🎉"

62,"Belgium's second city, the Port of Antwerp is one of the largest and busiest ports in Europe. A network of railway lines and #highways serves this dense metropolis which is home to about 1.2 million people. Sweco Nederland accomplished a complex redesign for the Oosterweel Connection Antwerp road project by sharing #3D model information between specialized design teams. Sweco utilized a number of Bentley solutions - ProjectWise, Openroads Designer, and LumenRT - to implement significant #road changes within eight weeks. By simulating & evaluating design alternatives, the project team saved 4 months and €400,000 💶.To prepare Antwerp for sustainable mobility, this highway project will relieve traffic congestion, while reducing noise pollution and improving air quality in the surrounding communities.#infrastructure #construction #transportation"

65,"Quoting John Quincy Adams, ex-US president, ""Successful leaders inspire others to learn more, do more and become more"". Being in this industry for more than 2 decades now, I was fortunate to be around and work with many such inspiring leaders. It has kept the fire in me going and always aspiring for the next challenge. But what happened last few weeks is something that I had not even dreamt of. So, here is what happened. I was announced as one of the finalists for ""Inspire"" category for this year's ADV D India Awards. This is an individual award that celebrate women who challenge the status quo of technology. From the time of announcement of finalists, wishes poured in from all around. I felt overwhelmed with so many calls and pings from Siemens colleagues with whom I had hardly interacted. I had never realized that my work or coaching initiative or even the little talks in different Siemens events had such a great influence and gained me supporters / well wishers from all Siemens ADV D India locations. It sounded like everyone (except me) were confident that I would win the award. And guess what, I did win :). Up until then, I had the feeling of impostor syndrome, always thinking that I was lucky to succeed or things just worked in my favor. But this time, I had to really give credit to myself. It would be impossible to pass through all the levels of juries with just luck. What made the award even more special is when my manager Chethan Seegehalli, peers and team cheered and celebrated my win, when our CEO Pankaj Vyas said ""Well deserved"". So, here i am proudly talking about my win (getting comfortable with the uncomfortable feeling of talking about myself) as this one is special :)"

67,"Das?! Das sind doch keine Influencer:innen! Als ich zum „IBM Influencer Forum“ eingeladen wurde, dachte ich nur: „Ähm, ja… da passe ich ja rein wie eine Veganerin beim Metzger!“ 😅Ich bin kein Fan vom Influencertum. Meine Oma hat mir beigebracht, dass „Beeinflussen“ keine positive Eigenart ist. Und ich finde sie hat Recht. Umso mehr begeistert war ich, als ich die Teilnehmenden in Ehningen gesehen habe: alles Menschen, die für Themen stehen und einstehen. 🫶Menschen, die ich gerne als Topic Leaders bezeichne. Denn wenn man sich mit ihnen trifft oder ihnen auf LinkedIn folgt stellt man schnell fest, dass es hier nicht um Beeinflussen geht, sondern um voneinander lernen.Egal mit wem ich gesprochen habe: ich habe gelernt, gelacht, diskutiert, gegrübelt und das Gefühl gehabt, noch ewig mit allen sprechen zu können, weil sie viel zu sagen hatten… 🤓Vielen Dank, liebe Petra und lieber Daniel, dass ihr den Ort des Austauschs ermöglicht habt. 🙏 ( Für alle, die gerne etwas über den Quantencomputer wissen wollen – es kommt noch ein Posting dazu. 😉)Welchen Topic Leadern sollte ich noch folgen?#thoughtleadership #leaders #community #ibm #linkedin"
