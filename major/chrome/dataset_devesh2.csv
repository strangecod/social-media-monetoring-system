20,"Flipkart is not laying off its employees. Read that again! Flipkart is NOT laying off its employees! Sounds strange considering the news that’s all around us, isn't it? 👀Recently, Krishna Raghavan, the Chief people officer at Flipkart said and I quote, “.. there are no mass layoffs happening at Flipkart.”This brings us to an important question. When the biggest tech giants of the world are struggling in this time of turmoil, what different has Flipkart done to retain its talent?Here are 3 strategies that have worked in Flipkart’s favour so far:1️⃣ Prioritising responsible hiring:Unlike many of its competitors in the tech and IT services sector, Flipkart is not using ""over-hiring"" as a justification for layoffs. The company states that they do not hire thousands and then resort to extreme measures to reduce headcount.2️⃣ Facilitating internal mobility:Flipkart understands that monotony and lack of lateral movement lead to a large chunk of employees quitting their jobs. To optimise its hiring efforts, Flipkart has lately increased internal job postings against hiring from the industry.This helps employees already acquainted with the company to move to different job roles of their choice. It increases the overall efficiency of the company while saving them a lot on hiring processes.3️⃣ Generous employee stock options:In November 2022, Flipkart went for an ESOP buyback plan of $700 million and also gave an increment to over 4000 senior managers to bring in pay parity within the company. Flipkart has now become one of the very few startups in India where ESOPs actually turn into liquidation opportunities for employees.Overall, Flipkart's approach to talent management demonstrates true commitment to responsible hiring & providing growth opportunities for its employees, even in times of uncertainty. ✨Such stories are rare to find in these times of turmoil and ought to be shared!

But getting the chance to see everyone face-to-face, catch up on work and life, and collaborate on projects in person was truly invigorating.There's just something special about being in the same physical space as your teammates.  I'm fascinated by the prospects of the metaverse and having tried it, it is quite compelling and getting better and better each day.  But in person time is absolutely special!  Not only did it make communication and collaboration more seamless, it also fostered a stronger sense of camaraderie and team spirit that's hard to replicate virtually.  We were able to have spontaneous meetings and breakout sessions, grabbed lunch and coffee together to build trust and bond, and engaged in team-building activities that simply couldn't be done over video.While I enjoyed all our team programming and learned tons throughout from my amazing teammates, my favorite part of our onsite was the visit to and volunteer work at the Ecumenical Hunger Program of East Palo Alto (www.ehpcares.org), where we helped stock shelves and distribute food to those in need in our surrounding community. 🙏🏼   A close second favorite moment was Lauren Tang and I celebrating our 10th work anniversaries, or as we call it, Metaversaries (and the team gifting me an amazing personalized Arsenal F.C. jersey 🏆 ).  Some fun pictures attached. Overall, I feel incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to reunite with the team in person. It's reminded me of the importance of human connection and collaboration, and I'm looking forward to more in-person gatherings in the future.

77,"The most powerful quantum computer in Europe🇪🇺: potential for materials research, logistics and defenceA number of corporate influencers and thought leaders, including Yannick Fasters  and myself, had the opportunity to take a look at the highly complex system at the IBM Influencer Forum this week.The #IBMQuantum System One was ceremonially put into operation in 2021 in the presence of the then German Chancellor and Doctor of Physics Angela Merkel. Together with IBM, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft operates the quantum computer in Ehningen near Stuttgart. The special feature: All processed project and user data remain in Germany at all times and are subject to German data protection regulations. 👉😉 #dataprotection Today, the system is used by a large number of customers who want to explore the potential of this revolutionary technology for industrial use. Quantum physics will make things possible at the latest with the availability of a computer with a sufficient number of Qbits that would take an eternity with traditional computers or cannot even be calculated at all.The ultra-fast supercomputers, in combination with artificial intelligence, could create performance boosts for more value creation in the medium term. Dr. Jan-Rainer Lahmann mentioned medical technology, logistics and materials research as obvious examples of applications. For example, Volkswagen wants to use quantum computers on the one hand to develop new materials for car manufacturing, and on the other hand to simulate new urban traffic concepts for metropolises with millions of inhabitants.Experts also see the possibility of using quantum computers to stabilise critical security infrastructures, develop better algorithms for industrial production and better model battery and fuel cells.The computer in Ehningen contains 127 Qbits. If you were to order a quantum computer from IBM today, there would even be 433 quantum bits available in the Osprey system. Towards the end of the year, researchers expect a system with over 1000 quantum bits. That is a big leap forward in development. In 2018, these computers were still at 72 Qbits.Here are 10 quantum computing applications you should know about:👉Artificial intelligence👉Better batteries👉Cleaner fertilization👉Cybersecurity👉Drug development👉Electronic materials discovery👉Financial modelling👉Solar capture👉Traffic optimization👉Weather forecasting👉Climate changeThanks a lot to Petra Bernhardt, Daniel Unkelhäußer and the whole IBM team for this exciting journey into a technology that can shape the European ecosystem. #technology"

Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.Augmented reality is used to either visually change natural environments in some way or to provide additional information to users. The primary benefit of AR is that it manages to blend digital and three-dimensional (3D) components with an individual's perception of the real world. AR has a variety of uses, from helping in decision-making to entertainment.AR delivers visual elements, sound and other sensory information to the user through a device like a smartphone or glasses. This information is overlaid onto the device to create an interwoven experience where digital information alters the user's perception of the real world. The overlaid information can be added to an environment or mask part of the natural environment. #augmentedreality"

118,"L'industrie du jeu vidéo vient de vivre une semaine dont on se souviendra longtemps... Tout ce que tu dois savoir des récentes actualités à ne pas manquer 👇🎨 Epic Games repousse les limites de Fortnite avec l'Unreal Editor. Cette intégration permet désormais aux joueurs de créer des expériences plus immersives et personnalisées qu'auparavant, renforçant la position de Fortnite comme plateforme créative. Maximiser l'interopérabilité entre les moteurs de rendu et proposer un meilleur partage de revenus avec les créateurs semblent être au cœur de ce nouveau dispositif, qui pourrait bien bouleverser la ""creator economy"". 🔫 Après des semaines de teasing, Valve corporation ""surprend"" avec l'annonce de CS 2 prévu pour cet été ! Le ""CS:GO killer"" fait déjà parler de lui, et les retours semblent unanimes : la communauté attend de pied ferme cette mise à jour. Preuve à l'appui : l'annonce a permis à la licence de battre son record de joueurs simultanés sur Steam, avec un pic atteignant 1 519 457 joueurs. 📉 Selon le SELL - Syndicat des Éditeurs de Logiciels de Loisirs, le marché français du jeu vidéo connaît une baisse de son chiffre d'affaires en 2022, avec 5,5 milliards d'euros (-1.6% par rapport à 2021). Cette baisse s'explique notamment par la crise économique que nous rencontrons actuellement, ou encore la pénurie de composants impactant sensiblement les ventes de consoles et autres périphériques. Une baisse relative, qui permet surtout de souligner la résilience de l'industrie en ces temps compliqués. 🌐 CCP Games, développeur du célèbre jeu EVE Online, sécurise 40 M$ de financement pour développer un nouveau jeu basé sur la technologie Web3. Ce financement soutiendra la création d'un MMO de science-fiction décentralisé. La technologie permettra aux joueurs de posséder et de monétiser leurs biens virtuels.🍿 Netflix étoffe son offre de jeux vidéo avec 40 nouveaux titres à venir pour 2023, dont des exclusivités Ubisoft ! Une stratégie ambitieuse pour la plateforme de streaming, qui souhaite se positionner comme un leader dans l'industrie du jeu vidéo dans les prochaines années.📉 L'action FaZe Clan connaît une chute ""embarrassante"", avec des performances boursières décevantes qui font parler d'elle, et par ricochet, du secteur de l'esport. L'équipe américaine pourrait bientôt être délistée du Nasdaq... 🎮 Le jeu MultiVersus encore sous le feu des projecteurs ! Ses joueurs réclament un remboursement sur les achats in-game après avoir appris la fermeture prochaine de la bêta. Les développeurs travaillent sur des mises à jour et prévoient un lancement officiel courant 2024, mais cela n'a pas suffi à calmer la frustration de la communauté qui attendait beaucoup de ce titre, qui, pour rappel, a perdu plus de 90% de sa player-base depuis ses premiers jours._ _ _ Dis-moi ce que tu penses de tout ça en commentaire 👇Tu ne veux rien manquer de l'actualité forte du jeu vidéo ? 🎮Abonne-toi et active la 🔔 sur mon profil 😉#gaming"

Inside the cave is a Shiva Lingam made of ice considered to be the most holy symbol by devotees all across the globe. Devotees visit it in large numbers from June to August, with the pilgrimage tour famously known as Amarnath Yatra, which begins from Chandanwari. It is considered to be one of the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas, or the holiest shrines in Hinduism. The place where the Amarnath Cave stands today is the same place where Lord Shiva explained the meaning of life and eternity to his consort & wife, Goddess Parvati. Bhrigu Muni, a famous sage in Hinduism, was the first person to have discovered this holy site. At that time, the entire Kashmir Valley was submerged under water, and Kashyap Muni, another powerful sage, drained the waters with his divine powers. As the waters cleared, Bhrigu Muni was the first person to have the site of the Shiva Lingam.In 1989, pilgrims numbered between 12,000 and 30,000. In 2011, the numbers reached a peak, crossing 6.3 lakh (630,000) pilgrims. In 2018 pilgrims numbered 2.85 lakh (285,000).
