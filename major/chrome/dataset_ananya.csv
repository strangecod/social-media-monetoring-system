14,"How much money can you make from brand collabs on Linkedin?Let's start from the beginning...99% of you are writing on LinkedIn for the wrong reasons.You're writing because:• FOMO• Looks cool• Brand collabsInstead of writing to:✅Build your business✅Build a network of HNIs✅Build a distributionWriting content and everything is all fancy, but let's do some math:→ It takes 30-40 minutes to write 1 post→ To grow actively, you have to post 25-30 times a month→ Let’s take the lower end→ So, total time invested = 30*25 minutes = 750 minutes or 12.5 hours per month!Now, you’ll also have to spend some time engaging with your audience and building a network.→ On the minimum, you’d have to spend 1 hour every day on the platform. → So, on a monthly basis, you have to spend 1*30 = 30 hours per month⇒ Total until now, 12.5 + 30 = 42.5 Hours or 5.3 working days (assuming an 8 hours work day)⏰So, you’re technically spending 1 working week in a month, just because you want to get some likes?Now, let’s make things a little bit more real.🔥 → Most people (read: students) are creating content because they want create a passive income stream via brand collabsCool. Sounds fancy. Let me break it down.→ Most brands will approach you once you cross 10,000 followers atleast → The desired commercial rate is (“number of followers”/2). → So, you’ll get around 3K-5K for one promotion. On an average students take around 6-10 months to build that kind of an audience. → So, time invested, 5.3 days/month * 6 = 31.8 Days→ You’re basically spending around a month’s time to even reach a level where you can get brand collabs.Well, if you spend this much time, day & night, learning a skill, it’ll give you returns way MORE than brand collabs and for way LONGER than just 1 post. 💸The point?Well, if you're posting on LinkedIn 'only' because you want to make money from brand collabs, you’re straight-up wasting your time. I couldn’t be more clear. Sorry.(You'll earn 10x from brand collabs on other platforms like Instagram & YT, trust me!)So, either rethink your business here, or save your time and learn something useful!Remember, spending the same time with the right strategy can give you 6-figures on LinkedIn, while you’re just stuck eyeing brand collabs!In fact, people who're making the most money out of brand collabs, their primary source of earning is not even collabs!Shall I let you in on a little secret?🤫I have 75,000+ followers and my income from brand collabs is at max 20% of my total income. Going by this percentage, you’re stuck making INR 200x from promotions when you can be making INR 800x.  Don't fool yourself. THINK PEOPLE THINK!Just because ChatGPT has made it easier to write content, it doesn't mean you'll do it without a strategy in place.

21,"My M.Tech research interview experience at Indian Institute of Science (IISc)Last year, I had the opportunity to attend the interview process of the M.Tech by Research programs at the CSA department at IISc.Firstly, for CSA, there are three pools to choose from -A. Theoretical Computer Science, consisting of Algorithms, TOC, graph theory and discrete math, cryptography and security, Approximation and randomization, geometry etc.,B. Computer Systems, consisting of operating system, architecture, compilers, computer security, high performance computing etc.,C. Intelligence Systems, consisting of machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics, reinforcement learning etc.I chose Pool C so, I was asked questions related to areas, ranging from basic data structures and programming skills to linear algebra and probability.Prepare from standard textbooks for whatever pool you are applying. Find related NPTEL videos on YouTube and try to understand the concepts well.For example, if you are appearing for pool C then, for Linear algebra you can refer to 3blue1brown or MIT Gilbert Strang lectures on Youtube. For Probability you can refer to Sheldon Ross textbook, etc.Some of the questions I remember were 1) given some constraints can you derive uniform distribution and find it's expectation? 2) Given system of equations with some constraints what kind of solutions they have?One of the most important things that they look for is a strong understanding of fundamental concepts. They are interested in your ability to apply your knowledge to real-life problems. Mathematics is a crucial part of these programs, so they expect a strong foundation in that. They want to see how well you can approach problems and arrive at solution.This is not about how many formulas you know or how many properties you can recite. They look for your thought process and approach to the problem. Even if you cannot solve a problem, they are interested in how you discuss and approach the problem with them. They might even provide you with hints and support your thought process.During the interview, I found that the faculties were flexible about the area in which I wanted to work. You can also discuss their research work and your interest.Here are some final tips to prepare for the interview process:1. Focus on your fundamentals and make sure you understand the underlying concepts clearly.2. Don't throw fancy keywords or concepts at the interview if you don't really understand them. For example ""deep learning and neural networks"" etc. unless you know them well with underlying math and how they work. They can easily tell if you are not being honest.3. You can visit google scholar profile of 2-3 professors under whom you want to work and know about their ongoing research. This can be strong and positive topic of discussion during interview.Good luck to all of you!#machinelearning #gate2023 #gatecse #iiscbangalore #mtech #research"

24,"The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.There is no realistic way to implement a moratorium and stop all teams from scaling up LLMs, unless governments step in. Having governments pause emerging technologies they don’t understand is anti-competitive, sets a terrible precedent, and is awful innovation policy. Responsible AI is important, and AI has risks. The popular press narrative that AI companies are running amok shipping unsafe code is not true. The vast majority (sadly, not all) of AI teams take responsible AI and safety seriously. Let's invest more in safety while we advance the technology, rather than stifle progress.A 6 month moratorium is not a practical proposal. To advance AI safety, regulations around transparency and auditing would be more practical and make a bigger difference."

Ich dürfte mit ca. 50 anderen Forumsbesuchern im IBM Headquarter D.A.CH. den einzigen deutschen Quantencomputer besuchen.Die simple Antwort auf die Frage, ob dieser Computer intelligent ist lautet: Wir denken noch zu linear. 🤯 Schon nach 2 Minuten merkte ich, wie groß meine Wissenslücke ist. Der super spannende Vortrag von Dr. Jan-Rainer Lahmann offenbarte mir das eindringlich. Folgende 3 Insights habe ich erstmal mitgenommen.✅ Der Quantencomputer ist nicht einfach ein besserer und schnellerer Rechner. Er/Sie/Es ist eine ganz neue Art der Informationsverarbeitung und Bereitstellung. Ich muss mich dringend mit den Grundlagen der Quantenphysik vertraut machen. Sonst verstehe ich das Potenzial eines Quantencomputers nicht. ✅ Im Gegensatz zum normalen Computer kennt er mehr als 2 Zustände. Diese liegen zwischen 0-1. Das ermöglicht parallele Berechnungen. Schrödingers Katze kann also wirklich gleichzeitig leben oder nicht leben. Und damit komme ich zum spannendste Faktor. ✅ Der Quantencomputer ist NICHT für rein logische Berechnungen da. Auf die Frage, ob Schrödinger's Katze lebt, kann er nach jeder Berechnung eine andere Antwort geben. Die immer ein etwas anderes Ergebnis bedeutet.🤷‍♂️ Ganz ehrlich. Ich hab es immer noch nicht verstanden. Aber ich weiß jetzt. Ich will es verstehen.Dank des Forum's habe ich nun direkten Zugang zu den Experten. Auch im Bereich #ai war Kenza Ait Si Abbou direkt zur Beantwortung meiner Fragen vor Ort. PS: Für alle die schon weiter sind als ich. Ihr könnt das Ding kostenlos über die IBM Cloud testen.https://lnkd.in/e_UuUrXg#ibmquantum #influencer #corporateinfluencer #ibm Und mein ganz persönlicher Dank gilt den Organisatoren:innen Petra Bernhardt, Jürgen Schmitt, Katrin-Cécile Ziegler und Daniel Unkelhäußer.

37,"To legal enthusiasts out there,Here is the compilation of 10 Most Important Judgments in IPR a law student must know. 1. Diamond v. Chakrabarty (1980) - This case established that genetically modified organisms are patentable subject matter under U.S. law.2. Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. (1984) - This case established the ""Betamax defense,"" which allows for the sale of devices with substantial non-infringing uses even if they can be used for infringing purposes.3. Diamond v. Diehr (1981) - This case established that computer software can be patentable subject matter under U.S. law if it provides a tangible and useful result.4. eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C. (2006) - This case established that an injunction is not always the appropriate remedy for patent infringement and that a court must consider the equitable factors of the case before granting an injunction.5. KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. (2007) - This case established that the obviousness of an invention must be considered in light of the prior art as a whole and that a combination of known elements may be considered obvious if it yields predictable results.6. Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International (2014) - This case established that abstract ideas implemented on a computer are not patentable subject matter under U.S. law.7. Novartis AG v. Union of India (2013) - This case involved a challenge to the patentability of a cancer drug and established that Section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act does not allow for the patenting of new forms of known substances unless they exhibit significantly improved efficacy.8. Golan v. Holder (2012) - This case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which restored copyright protection to works that had previously been in the public domain, and established that Congress has the power to restore copyright protection to works that have fallen into the public domain.9. Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. (2002) - This case established the doctrine of equivalents, which allows a patentee to claim infringement of a patent even if the accused product or process does not literally infringe the patent claims but is equivalent to them.10. Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. (2012) - This case involved a patent dispute between Apple and Samsung over smartphone technology and established that design patents can cover the ornamental aspects of a product, even if they are not essential to the product's function.I know, I’ve left behind many important judgements.

43,"In 2013, Buffer was struggling to grow its user base for its social media scheduling app. The company's co-founder, Leo Widrich, decided to reach out to users to get their feedback on the app.This is a stimulus.Every small feature you have developed goes for testing. Once the internal testing is done, there is external testing gets done by existing users or colleagues from a different field, etc.This happens whenever you push the code to production. Why?Taking a step back and deciding to talk to “non-tech” people, you understand the essential parts of the work you did, and how others are perceiving the work you do. You understand the real-world application of the technology that you have developed. As an engineer, your task is most often building the blocks. But when you take off your engineering hat, you see how people from other fields take the blocks that you have developed and make a use case that was never on your mind. So, Buffer’s founder started by asking a group of bloggers for their opinions on the app. One blogger told him that while she liked the idea of the app, she found it difficult to use and not intuitive. This feedback was surprising to him, as he had thought the app was user-friendly. You can just never know how changing the color of one button can make all the difference. Remember just because JSON is a cakewalk for you doesn’t mean it is for non-techies!When the “like” button came live, Facebook went through a phase when they were having a problem with the retention of the user. They couldn’t understand why they were failing even though they had a “like” button to make it engaging. After talking to some users, they understood that users didn’t want to “like” sad news, and this gave them so much insight. Hence, multiple reactions came into the picture. That’s why it becomes essential to talk to non-tech people to understand if what you think aligns with non-tech savvy. TL;DR -It provides perception It shows the knowledge gap.It is a way to make your technology more effective.It shows an enthusiasm in others to learn from you. This is an amazing boost to your confidence. Many times, you will find people listening to you like you are the absolute best in the industry. You might not be that person but since, you know your field, you are best at what you do. For a developer, it’s immensely necessary to understand what and how the world takes up space in the development world, and how you can take the space in the non-development world and learn from there!"

This can always be planned before or after the month- Organizing a team dinner during the month where everyone in the company can break-fast together- Every year, Muslims donate a certain proportion of wealth to charitable causes. Google has an employee program to match donations 1:1 as long as it is a registered charity.

Together with IBM, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft operates the quantum computer in Ehningen near Stuttgart. The special feature: All processed project and user data remain in Germany at all times and are subject to German data protection regulations. 👉😉 #dataprotection Today, the system is used by a large number of customers who want to explore the potential of this revolutionary technology for industrial use. Quantum physics will make things possible at the latest with the availability of a computer with a sufficient number of Qbits that would take an eternity with traditional computers or cannot even be calculated at all.The ultra-fast supercomputers, in combination with artificial intelligence, could create performance boosts for more value creation in the medium term. Dr. Jan-Rainer Lahmann mentioned medical technology, logistics and materials research as obvious examples of applications. For example, Volkswagen wants to use quantum computers on the one hand to develop new materials for car manufacturing, and on the other hand to simulate new urban traffic concepts for metropolises with millions of inhabitants.Experts also see the possibility of using quantum computers to stabilise critical security infrastructures, develop better algorithms for industrial production and better model battery and fuel cells.The computer in Ehningen contains 127 Qbits. If you were to order a quantum computer from IBM today, there would even be 433 quantum bits available in the Osprey system. Towards the end of the year, researchers expect a system with over 1000 quantum bits. That is a big leap forward in development. In 2018, these computers were still at 72 Qbits.Here are 10 quantum computing applications you should know about:👉Artificial intelligence👉Better batteries👉Cleaner fertilization👉Cybersecurity👉Drug development👉Electronic materials discovery👉Financial modelling👉Solar capture👉Traffic optimization👉Weather forecasting👉Climate changeThanks a lot to Petra Bernhardt, Daniel Unkelhäußer and the whole IBM team for this exciting journey into a technology that can shape the European ecosystem. #technology"

My weekend classes started from April last year and today I have completed 4 semesters of the 2 year long course. Managing a full time job, family, and executive education is not easy.

103,"Building and scaling offline GT distribution is one of the most difficult things to achieve in the journey of building consumer brandsIn our journey of expanding our presence to 200+ cities & 15000+ stores, here are 3 unique things we did that helped us in the initial daysa) No Hard Sales Targets:Instead of having sales targets, we had targets on input metrics. For us, the most important metric was the number of counters visited every day and the quality of each visit.In the initial days, you will face rejection daily. And it is purely about perseverance. In the first couple of visits to big counters, the shop owner will not even speak with you. In the third visit, maybe he will offer you tea and understand about the product/brand. And maybe in the 4th/5th visit, he will give you the first order.And this behavior of the retailer is intentional to an extent. Sub-consciously he checks how serious the sales person is about building the brand. If the sales guy keeps visiting him continuously for weeks, there is a high chance that he will agree for the stock placementb) Leveraging Digital to build Retailer awareness:In each of our visits to the counters, we used to collect the business card of the shops. These business cards had the contact details of the retailers. We started creating custom audiences for the retailers and started running ads on all digital platforms.This made the brand and the product familiar to the retailers.In addition to normal feature/led ads, a lot of the ads were around awards/recognition that we had received. This built trust amongst retailersBrand Familiarity and Trust are the 2 things most critical to get a retailer to stock an early stage brand. This is why you would often hear legacy brands activating TV and Print ads to get trade to believe in the brand. But digital allows you to do the same in a much more cost effective and intelligent wayc) In Person Sellout:Placement for the first time is still relatively easier. But if the products don’t sell from the counters, the brand is dead and buried.To enable sellouts, I used to go and work as a shop boy in the top counters on weekends( high customer walk-ins). In addition to the obvious benefit of kickstarting sellout from the stores, this helped us in multiple ways:- When the retailer see you pitching the product, they get an understanding on what to communicate. Their training gets completed- It helps you get a lot of first hand consumer insights which are used to improve product & marketing communicationOver time, this got institutionalized and everyday our sales folks and all leaders in market visits interact and pitch to customers wherever possible.Building and scaling General Trade in India is tough. But then again, when was the last time you found something worth building which wasn't tough :)P.S. Old pic from one of the days when I was working as a shopboy :)"

132,"Last year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won praise from the right for retaliating against Disney for its CEO’s decision to (rather timidly) wade into the public discourse over a contentious state law. In that first round of Florida’s GOP vs The Walt Disney Company, DeSantis landed a body blow that ultimately cost Disney CEO Bob Chapek his job.For DeSantis, a potential presidential contender in 2024, the standoff burnished his reputation on the right as a shrewd leader who won’t be easily pushed around, not even by one of the state’s largest employers.But now, in round two, DeSantis, age 44, is going up against longtime Disney boss Bob Iger, a Hollywood power player with decades more experience on the national stage. And Iger, at age 72, isn’t pulling any punches. Iger, who retired in 2020 only to return to the helm nearly three years later when Chapek was forced out (more on that later), doesn’t have much time to mess around. He’s given himself a two-year deadline to line up a successor, and he’s got to do that all while trying to reinvigorate a 100-year-old sprawling media conglomerate.Analysis by CNN's Allison Morrow"

199,"First-time homebuyers in America have never been older, and an influx of all-cash buyers, as well as a younger generation leaning financially on their parents for longer than ever before, has made it staggeringly difficult for older, lower-income renters to save enough for a home. In 2022, the typical American getting keys to a starter home was 36 years old, an all-time high, and many buyers are into their golden years before they can scrounge together a down payment.About 20% of buyers between the ages of 50 and 59 in 2022 were purchasing for the first time, according to Zillow’s Consumer Housing Trends Report. Eleven percent of buyers aged 60 to 69 were first-time homeowners, and among buyers over the age of 70, 7% were buying for the first time.For many of those buyers, the desire to lock in costs as they transition to a fixed income is reason enough to finally shift from renting to owning, said Jeff Tucker, a senior economist at Zillow. “As they’re considering how their pension, social security and income will be fairly fixed moving forward, the beauty of the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is that you don’t have to worry that rising rents could force you out,”  Zucker said."
