55,"I love this challenge coin my leaders Robert (Steve) Stoker and Anibal ""J.R."" Nieves at work gave us!Traditionally, challenge coins are given to service members and law enforcement personnel for achievement, recognition and morale. So in that same spirt we have been given this coin. You can see the Microsoft logo and the mission statement on the front. Then on the back the team I am apart of and the AD Ninja logo. This logo and idea came around internally around 6 years ago by highly esteemed colleague Justin Turner. The idea is that we are AD Ninjas fighting for our customers and colleagues on advisory, break/fix and disaster recovery of AD environments and to encourage continued AD learning. I actually created the artwork for the coin as one of my leaders reached out asking if I would like to assist in bringing the challenge coin idea to life. You may notice a misspelling which took place during the proofing process (I assure you all, in my artwork there were no misspellings) of the coin development which just makes this coin even more unique if you ask me. We all laugh about it now.It's great to work in an environment where you are appreciated! #Microsoft #MicrosoftEmployee #MicrosoftLife #ChallengeCoin #MoraleGift #Coin #Morale"

That’s why we are steadily working on creating the Metaverse with #Diversity, #Equity and #Inclusion in mind - because only  when everyone has an equal voice can we develop more inclusive products for people around the world. 🌍Research by McKinsey also proves women to be a driving force in implementing the #metaverse. It showed that female executives are 20% more likely to set up multiple metaverse initiatives than their male counterparts and that women overall are more likely to utilize hybrid use cases of the metaverse, such as gaming, live events, and shopping via AR/VR technologies. And as they illustrate so well, now it is time to increase the number of women in #leadership roles - across the metaverse and the entire industry. At Meta we doubled the number of women in our global workforce compared to 2019 and increased female leadership positions to a total of 37,1% - and we won’t stop there! 🚀Read more about our efforts to build an inclusive and equal metaverse: https://lnkd.in/eNXN5Ctf"

The reality now for me is I have started a journey finally embracing my bajan curls a curly head of hair that changes each day depending on the weather, the evening protective style, the finger detangle and my own mood!!For the first time thanks to my son educating me and the help of social media I embrace my curls I couldn’t pic a favourite curly picture so sharing a few Thank you LinkedIn and Dove I LOVE my curls and I will never pat them flat again #blackhairisprofessional"

The competition is open to undergrads and grad students at accredited colleges and universities across the Cascadia Corridor – Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia, as well as Alaska.The prototype uses a custom-built 3x3 sensor mat coupled with an accelerometer connected to an Adafruit ESP32 feather that maps the readings of the sensor matrix to a TFT screen and uploads the data to the cloud.

109,"Just wanted to put out my thoughts regarding relocation. I have been observing a trend of many companies offering remote roles while some companies are still asking employees to relocate. While there are pros and cons to both approaches, I just wanted to outline some of the struggles for a complete relocation from an employee point of view-1. Finding movers-  If the company provides relocation assistance great! , else you will need to get different quotes and start packing your stuff.  You will need to schedule movers and plan your travel accordingly.2. Finding a new place to live - Again, even with relo assistance it's hard to quickly find a new apartment or home which matches your criteria of no of bedrooms, parking spaces, yard etc  and it's more challenging if you are moving to a more expensive place. This is especially challenging if employer does not offer temporary housing. Plus additional hassle of selling or renting your current home as applicable. 3. Car shipping- Apart from the move you will need to find a good company to ship your cars. Some people employ a strategy to sell cars and buy new ones to prevent this.4. Social - You can always find new coworkers but it's hard to start making social connections from scratch. This becomes increasingly difficult as you get older. Social life may include work friends, yoga friends,  friends you take a walk with, friends you have coffee with, neighbours etc. Having this community around is extremely crucial for your mental health and overall well being. Building this back takes a lot of time. 5. Healthcare- Sometimes it may take months to find a good primary care physician in your insurance network, this also includes letting go of your favourite doctor or dentist and go through a gruelling find in another city or location. This is especially hard for people with health issues. 6. Kids or pets- Finding a good daycare or boarding for your pet, finding playdates for your kids, schooling change for kids, friends also would change for kids. This is a huge social challenge for the little ones. 7. Weather- When moving to a colder or hotter place, it takes time to acclimate to the weather.8.Misc- From redirecting mail to getting a new driver's license for the state, there are some additional misc items which need to be taken care of when moving. 9. Finding another/remote job for your spouse/ family member. From my perspective, this is a very long gruelling process and takes months if not years for someone to shift base completely. Is it really worth asking someone move and change their entire life? Wouldn't it be beneficial to the company if the employee instead works from their home and is productive immediately?What do you think? Should employers move to-1. Completely remote or 2. Keep it on site for jobs completely doable on a laptop. Do let me know in the comments! Also feel free to add if I've missed any points above. Thank you! 🙂"

155,"Google, Microsoft and Amazon laid off more than 70,000 employees last year. More layoffs are underway. Their profits in last quarter (not year, one quarter!) 2022: - Google: 40Bn$- Microsoft: 35Bn$- Amazon: 19.65Bn$ Important lessons if you are aiming for tier-1 jobs: [1] You are either a cost centre or profit centre to your firm. If you bring in 10L a year and get a salary of 8L, you will survive (if you are lucky), else you will not. [2] A good firm is a launchpad to better things. Not, the destination in itself. Don't get too cozy once you make it to the top firm. [3] A firm's cardinal goal is to look after its shareholders. And, your cardinal goal is to look after your career, very similar to how your CEO does. Brutal as it may sound: Team building exercises, dinners/lunches, over-arching visions of how the firm is changing the world are all theatrics that keeps you motivated to contribute to your firm. Nothing more. Don't lose sight of the fact that you are a one person army, who needs to look after your career."

159,"One of the best pieces of career advice I got in my early career is to “Talk to people”. I used to talk to people at very transactional levels especially when I had a job/an ask in my mind. This made me miss a larger opportunity to know about the problem that person is solving/working on. After getting that advice, I started asking out to people for a coffee chat, without any task in mind. It was super uncomfortable for me to start this. I had doubts/questions like what topic should I discuss, how to build the conversation, am I wasting his/her time, etc. Over a period, I started enjoying these conversations. It eventually became my habit. Lots of my learnings and exposure came from these casual chats. I got opportunities to work with a few great teams I never thought about. I identified use cases that I never believed existed. A few discussions stretched from 20 minutes to 1 hour and eventually became a lifelong connection.I felt like those discussions gave me more learning than reading a book. One simple thing that took me so long to understand. Now, I prefer taking an average course with great people to another way around. Talking to good people opens up far more opportunities than you believe. It’s a simple process: Discuss, experiment, reflect and repeat. Just keep exploring.#ExperienceFromTheField"

162,"So Hera Pheri 3 is finally happening! Look forward to being back on set with Pareshji & Akki. Like all good things, this one took some time, but it’s a relief to finally have an answer to this question! #Films are such a huge part of our culture, and yet, not many understand what goes into making a film. Apart from creative challenges, the #businessmodel & needs of the #movie business make it as challenging as any other.There are several factors for any business to succeed - a good idea, thorough market research, a solid business plan, a skilled team, funding at the right time & a strong distribution network.The movie business isn’t very different. To explain the entirety of the movie business here would be over simplifying it. But let's just say having a good script, a set of actors & a director is literally just the start point.There’s the #financing of a movie. It's usually #studios or #productionhouses, which invest their own #capital. Their teams assess the viability of a project before deciding on the budget.Some large films are financed through pre-sales and distribution deals, in which the distribution rights for the film are sold in advance to distributors and/or streaming platforms.Like the startup world, access to financing depends on the size of the film, as well as the connections & resources available to the producers & investors involved.Another key aspect in the movie business is #distribution. It’s a complex process that involves several layers like producers, distributors & exhibitors.Once a film’s made, a studio typically either sells the distribution rights to a distributor or appoints one on a commission basis, who is then responsible for securing screens from theatre owners, negotiating terms & releasing the film in theatres. Sometimes distributors negotiate a % of the box office collections.There are several other ways to monetise films.#BoxOffice collections, domestic & international, are the primary ones. Success depends on various factors, including the star cast, genre, music & the buzz created.Then come the #TV (satellite) & #OTT (digital) rights, which are a significant % of overall revenue. These deals can be fairly structured at times. Recently these values shot through the roof, but have become more rational off late.#MusicRights are another important source of revenue. Usually sold to a #musiclabel who in turn monetise it through channels like streaming, licensing, digital ad revenues etc.Many films also tie-up with #brands for in-film placements or co-marketing activities, as an additional layer of revenue, or sometimes to offset part of the pre release marketing expenses.There are so many other aspects that make the movie business challenging - audience preferences, data & insights, IP rights & licences, pre & post production, line production, permissions, promotions, pricing etc etc33 years & 125 films later I don’t have it all figured out, but I will keep getting better at it 🙏"

184,"Shri Kedarnath is amongst the holiest pilgrimages for the devout Hindus. It is set amidst the stunning mountain scape of the Garhwal Himalayas at the head of the Mandakini River. Kedar is another name of Lord Shiva, the protector and the destroyer.The Shivalingam at Shri Kedarnath temple is pyramid shaped and hence is unique among Shiva temples. In the Mahabharat war of 4000 BC, the finest flower of chivalry and heroism perished in the flames of war in a matter of eighteen days. Pandavas were guilty of over drive. They had no honour left and were having nightmares during sleep. It was Lord Krishna himself who advised them to seek the blessing of Lord Shiva. By getting Darshan of the form of light, the Pandavas were absolved of their sins.Bhima had fought with bull form of Shiva with maces, so he was struck with remorse. He massaged Shivas body with ghee. In memory of this event, Shivalingam at Kedarnath Ji is massaged with ghee even today. It's mentioned in scriptures that by visiting Shri Kedarnath Ji , sorrows do not come even in dreams.""Person may leave all his sins having journey to Kedarnath"". ~ Vyas Smriti.""The person get Shivloka by leaving his body (dead), being Mahaprasthana yatra that is joumey to Kedaraanchal"". ~ Shantiparva.""After taking bath in Kedarkhand and visiting Kedarnath temple in Krishnapaksha on chaturdashi, devotee get rid of all of their sins and get Swarga."" ~ Vana Purana.""Person will get Rudraloka having darshan of Kedar and bathing in Himalaya teertha."" ~ Kurma Purana.""Kedareshwar linga is situated at Himalayas which is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva. After visiting Kedareshwar Linga, devotees get rid of all their sins."" ~ Shiva Maha Purana.""Pandavas had asked Vyas ji for remedy for their sins which happened due to Gau hatya and Guru Hatya during the war of Mahabharat. Vyas ji told them to visit Kedarnath to get prayaschit"". ~ Skanda Purana.#india #kedarnath #sanatandharma #himalayas"

Our team recently went back to Japan for a business visit and one of our members had his first-ever Japanese adventure. 😍 Check out his experience at Asakusa, the cultural gem in Tokyo!✨On a beautiful sunny morning in January, he reached Asakusa station and the spectacular Tokyo Skytree welcomed him on one side, and his destination, Sensouji on the other. 🏯 The Kaminarimon (meaning Thunder Gate 🌩️) was his first stop, with an impressive red lantern and the character 雷(Thunder) written on it! It was awe-inspiring! 😲As he passed through Kaminarimon, Nakamise dori street greeted him with Japanese sweets, souvenirs, and fun shops. He couldn't resist the yummy Mitarashi Dango 🍡 and strawberry candy, and even bought an umbrella with a katana's hilt as the handle. 🌂😂The main temple was a serene experience, and he passed through the incense smoke, which is believed to ward off evil and bring good luck. 🙏 He even got a good fortune slip (吉, yay!) and an omamori before enjoying lunch with his friends. 😋The chilly weather didn't stop him from renting a Kimono and walking through Nakamise dori again! 😍 The Gojunoto (five-storied Pagoda), bronze Buddha statue, koi fishes in the pond, and of course, Kaminarimon, all looked marvelous from his Kimono! It was a memorable experience and he's been carrying his omikuji and omamori with him ever since! 🤞🍀Ravind Singam Samson Samuel Murugan CL Kumaresh Swaminathan#securityconsulting #cybersecurity #businesstravel #siem #cloudsecurity #infosec #japan #team #positka #experience"

249,"Recently, I read an article on AI (primarily Large Language Model) published by the Times of India (TOI), one of the largest English daily in India, on their opinion page. The author is a well-known name in India and published a few fictional books but with no background on AI (or at least I’m unaware of it). I found that article very shallow with a theme of sensationalizing this technology through nationalism. It was just an attempt to share some generics with the message “AI will take your jobs” or might colonize you.In contrast, a Few days back, Noam Chomsky wrote an article “The False Promise of ChatGPT” for NYT. It was a well-researched and thought-through attempt to explore the various nuances of this technology. This article showed how this technology shows some use cases but is still far from general intelligence. He compared LLMs to the human brain and discussed the differences.I put these two articles in contrast to visualize the difference in the quality of content on a very similar topic across the continents (by somewhat similarly strong media channels). India has a range of amazing people with real experience in this domain. They also have a strong voice and a large following. They could have written a piece with great depth that could have provided a good window into this technology for the readers.In one of the Hindi movies I watched, the protagonist used to call “wrong number” to things that were impractical or sometimes fake. I found this article from TOI as a “wrong number”. I’m unsure about the intent behind these botch-up efforts to share this technology with a broader audience. This audience may not have a technical background and may trust this news. A beautiful technology was stamped as a new way of colonialism. India deserves better. Better content and surely a thought process with logical opinions.#ExperienceFromTheField"

266,"#SteveJobs almost prevented the #iPhone from being created. And contrary to popular myth, the iPhone was NOT Steve Job's brainchild. Apple had done a massive turnaround with the iPOD. But by 2007, iPod was going to be disrupted, by mobile phones like Nokia 5310 that could play music. And iPods were almost half of Apple's revenue.Tony Fadell, the designer behind the first iPhones said “We had the music player doing video and audio and photo. We had iTunes. Then futurephones came out. They started playing MP3. This is a holy shit moment. Phones could steal everything we were doing. What could we do to counter this? ""But Jobs was against building phones for two reasons.One, Steve Jobs did not want to go through the orifices to get to the end users. By orifices, he meant carriers like Verizon and AT&T, which had final say over which phones could access their networks. Second, Jobs wasn’t convinced that the emerging smartphone category was going to be a wide market. He believed it would not go beyond the “pocket protector” crowd aka nerds. So instead they decided to partner with Motorola to create the iTunes phone - The Moto ROKR E1. And it bombed!Steve was still not convinced about building a phone. But his team was. And unknown to even Steve, the team started building the iPhone. They gutted an iPod, added Wifi and got the internet to run on the IPod. Steve's reaction "" This is bullsh**"". Steve didn't really see the path to success.However two Apple veterans, Mike Bell and Steve Sakoman, continued to lobby with Steve Jobs for months. They were convinced that computers, music players and cell phones were heading towards an inevitable convergence.On November 7, 2004, Bell sent an email to Jobs - ""Steve, I know you don't want to do a phone. But here's why we should do it. Jony Ives has some really cool designs for the future iPods that no one has seen. We ought to take one of those, put some Apple software around it, and make a phone ourselves instead of putting our stuff on other people's phone.Jobs called him right away and debated for hours. Finally he relented and agreed to build a phone.  - - - There are three key lessons in this story here : 1. The lone inventor myth. Far too often, we believe its one single person's will that forged a great product, often forgetting that countless incredible nameless people that work behind the scenes making some of the worlds best product.2. Even visionaries always don't have the best vision of the future. But a great team can probably help see the future better.3. It takes a lot of lobbying and story selling to get people to buy into your narrative. Far too often I see people give up just having pitched their idea barely a few times. It sometimes takes months, even years to sell a game changing story. ---Illustration courtesy Eleni Kalorkoti.Sources : Multiple Media Articles & The One Device - The Secret History of the iPhone , by Brian Merchant."

269,"🎉 Our DP playlist crosses 3 Million views in ~1 yearDynamic Programming, is arguably the most feared topic when we talk about DSA. It isn't only you, I also did not understand anything for the first time when I started with it during my second year. Back in my time, there was a lack of structured resources as well which did not make it easier. Last year I decided to bridge this gap and create an in-depth Dynamic Programming playlist, where we covered 56 problems. Every pattern in Dynamic Programming was taught by covering 5+ problems. I went through various existing playlists and made sure all the comments in those playlists were addressed when I made the DP playlist. Conceptually, we should always start with recursion, followed by memoization, followed by iterative DP to save recursive stack space, and then apply space optimization to save extra space used. All the above 4 methods have been covered in each of the 56 problems we have covered. None of the paid or free playlists in the market has covered it in such depth.If you are someone struggling with it, you can give this playlist a try and I can assure you that you won't regret it. We have also made sure to add detailed notes, with C++/Java/Python codes.

When the thing you want the most, takes longer to achieve, should you choose the easier, shorter path? Why is one path glorified and other reprimanded? As founders, do you wish you could trade one path for another? Send all your hot takes! #founders #wokewednesdaysP.S. Thanks Julian Kohann for sharing the quote!"

286,"Read “LLM in Intellectual Property and Corporate Law” in the title of someone on LinkedIn. I Got excited that Large Language Models will be disrupting such a complex domain and clicked on their profiles to learn more about it.Found they are lawyers with Masters's degrees without any connection to AI. I hallucinated this time. It's time to reduce the overfitting of my brain neurons. I won't blame the journalist who thought AI was ""Air India"" than ""Artificial Intelligence"".

287,"“Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity are the core focus and key pillars of all of our processes from recruiting, mentorship, and performance evaluations to every team meeting”.Hello, I am Jasmin Frick, Director of Seller Success at the Amazon MENA marketplace. Through my roles here, I’ve worked in Munich, London, and now Dubai. It has been a decade of working at Amazon and the amount of support, encouragement, and empathy I’ve received are unique to Amazon. Above all, it’s been my work in this environment that has accelerated my growth. Diversity, equity, and inclusion bring value every day in forging stronger results and efficient operations. A key step for me as a leader is to actively recruit people from diverse backgrounds, and foster collaboration and engagement between team members while mentoring the growth of diverse leaders. I’ve had the opportunity to work on some of our biggest rock projects where we live by the Leadership Principles of “Earn Trust, Ownership, Learn and Be Curious”, which embrace diversity and equity. My advice to women who are starting their professional journey while navigating bias and stereotypes is this: Join a company that embraces and lives by diversity and equity. Seek mentors, sponsors, and role models who will guide and support you. If you observe or experience biases and/or stereotypes in your workplace: be brave and speak up! This is critical to building inclusive workplaces. Learn more about working at Amazon: https://amzn.to/3iSsv5r#IWDxAMAZON, #EmbraceEquity, #InThisTogether, #InsideAmazon #AmazonMENA"

The seminar provided an excellent platform for professionals from the energy sector to come together and share insights on the latest trends, best practices and innovations in renewable energy.The seminar focused on the importance of cost excellence as a key strategy for sustainable business growth in the renewable power sector. The sessions covered a range of topics including leveraging technology to optimize costs, enhancing operational efficiency, adopting best practices in power financing, innovative financing models, new technologies for renewable power generation and transmission, and best practices for cost management.As someone who is passionate about sustainable energy and its role in driving economic growth, I found the seminar to be a valuable learning experience.

290,"“Kabhi bade sapne dekhne ki himmat hi nahi hui; Papa’s a farmer. So life hasn’t been easy. But it was harder for him. He’d walk overnight to reach school, until one day he had to drop out — having two square meals a day was getting difficult. Papa says that was the day he decided that he would ensure his kids never had to go through what he did.So when he had me at 25, he did all that he could. I knew of all his sacrifices, so at an early age, I dedicated myself to my studies. After school, my Tauji would help me with my homework. Since we didn’t have money to buy notebooks, Tauji would take a chalk and write on a broken wall near my house. That's how I learnt ABC and tables. Then, at 13, I had to move away for further studies as the nearest school was 20 km away. I was terrified; I had never lived alone. But Papa's words, ‘Tu padh. Baki ki chinta mat kar,' gave me the courage. For the next 4 years, I worked hard and topped my classes. I began taking an interest in my studies and for the first time, I dared to dream. I decided, ‘School ke baad, BTech karunga. Paise kamaunga.’ I guess when you're determined, things start working in your favour–I landed a full scholarship! Papa was the happiest. He patted my back and said, 'Jo main nahi kar saka, ab tu karega!'But college was a different zone altogether. Initially, I felt out of place – sab English bolte the. So, I decided to learn the language. Day and night, I'd watch videos and practice.  Side by side, I even started learning Java. I had become a sponge–absorbing and learning from everything I could. But a challenging time was yet to come–I graduated in the midst of the pandemic. Companies weren’t hiring, so for 5 months I was jobless. I had to move back home. But I didn't sit idle; I wanted to make use of my time so I researched where I could learn how to code and that's when I came across Newton School. I loved their courses so I enrolled for a 6-month course! My classes began in October 2021. I would practise coding day and night; I was barely sleeping. My hard work paid off– in my 4th month, I got placed at Lenskart! That day changed not only my life but also my family’s. I’m the first person in my family to work at a corporation! Maa and Papa said, ‘Garv hai tum par!’ You know, I gave my entire first salary to my family. Sab bahut khush hue – bade dino baad ghar mithai aayi thi.It’s been 8 months since I’ve started working and I finally feel capable of taking care of my family. They still live in that small house. But that’s what I’m working towards–buying a home. A home where everyone is well fed, a home where people aren’t worried about the roof falling off any minute. But most importantly, a home where both, the young and the old, are never afraid to dream big!”-Like Jagdish, you too can change your life by joining Newton’s Full Stack Development Course!

292,"As #AI continues to take the world by storm, the financial industry is no exception. More and more, financial leaders are leaning on AI to drive automation and better support overworked teams during this economic climate. Now there’s data to prove this. According to Microsoft’s Economic Guardians of the Future report, “Eighty-two percent of finance leaders found AI and automation very important in helping evolve their team’s role to support their organization’s strategic goals.” Georg Glantschnig wrote in Fortune how this data point offers financial leaders an opportunity to embrace more AI tools to reinforce their value as innovators.

293,"Update on the overall fiasco ( Good News ) :US regulators decided to bail out SVB customers.Every account holder can withdraw their money as the bank opens Monday - US time.100000+ employees might not receive salaries this month, 1000+ startups might do mass layoffs,Here is the reason 👇If you are working for a startup which is incorporated in the USThere is a 7/10 chance that your startup is banking with Silicon Valley Bank It almost has a 25% market share in the Silicon Valley and yesterday Silicon Valley bank shut down 😑The worst part, about $175B worth of deposits from startups are frozen and no one is able to withdraw money. Insurance covers only 5% of the total deposits in the bank 🤯And this happened in just the last 48 hours. Here is an explanation of what happened in the simplest way possible : You see Silicon Valley Bank majorly worked with startups.The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which made it more expensive for investors to borrow money.Overall startup funding scene slowed down because of that ( hence many layoffs have been happening recently )Because of this more startups were taking money than depositing.To give this money to its clients - startups, Silicon Valley Bank sold some of its investments, like bonds.The bank had bought these bonds when interest rates were lower, but had to sell them when interest rates were higher, Which caused the bank to lose money. Like almost $2BWhen this news came out, The stock fell rapidly as a result more startups started to withdraw money in a panic since existing investors suggested so 😒That depleted the bank's reserves even faster. SVB tried to raise more money but they failed to do so.Eventually, the bank had to shut down and be taken over by banking regulators.This is could be the second-largest banking collapse after the Lehman brothers What does this mean?If USA government and respective authorities don't step in and bail out,1000’s startups might lose the majority of their money,Leading to shutdown and mass layoffs.And that will definitely push the economy into a horrible recessionIf you think that this is happening in USA and if you are sitting in India, there will be no impact. You're mistaken! The majority of the Indian startups which raised funding are usually registered in US or SingaporeAnd if they are registered in is, there is a high probability that SVB is the only bank they work with. Now, what are the top learnings from this?Silicon Valley Bank's failure is a reminder that having single points of failure can be risky.- If you have only one bank, consider getting a second one.- If you rely on only one marketing channel, start testing more.- If you have only one critical employee, consider training more employees.- If you have only one major customer, consider diversifying your customer base to reduce the risk of losing that customer.

Net result? 120 VFX shots done by a team of 3 on a dime. Bravo! This is a milestone in creative technology. ⚙ Corridor basically made an open source video2anime workflow to pull off this video. Key tools they used are: - Stable Diffusion model + DreamBooth fine-tuning- Unreal Engine + asset store 3D models - Img2Img + DeFlickering effect- Heaps of gold ol' fashioned VFX compositingNow let's deconstruct their creation workflow:1. Train a model to replicate a specific style2. Train a model to know a character 🔄3. Run green screen video through img2img with controlled noise4. Reduce flicker with Deflicker plugin5. Add 3D elements in Unreal 56. Final VFX comp/edit in ResolveFor the final polish, Corridor added heaps of good old fashioned VFX e.g. - Speed lines to emphasize motion- Glows to emulate a film camera / cell animation- Dynamic elements (e.g. candles) in Unreal- Volumetric light rays to set the indoor mood+ 🔥editing & sound design!It's pretty wild what a scrappy team can do with generative AI combined with digital creation tools. *This is truly the rise of the 10x creator* Follow Bilawal Sidhu for more creative tech magic. #artificialintelligence #machinelearning #ml #ai #deeplearning #computervision #generativeai #aiart #aivideo #visualeffects #youtube #vfx #filmmaker #animation #creator"

332,"IPL gone. F1 gone. HBO gone.What’s happening to Hotstar?👇👇Hotstar is doing something strange.It has given up IPL to Viacom.It has given up F1 to F1TV.And now it is giving up HBO to Prime Video.Why?This is part of Hotstar’s new strategy: Don’t pay for rights. Focus on originals.Before this, Hotstar assumed that if you want to attract subscribers, you must have sports content.That’s why Hotstar paid for expensive IPL rights and expensive F1 rights.But then Netflix showed a new approach: F1 Drive to Survive.Instead of showing live F1 races, Netfix made a documentary about F1 called Drive to Survive.Drive to Survive became a massive hit. F1 fans loved it.But more importantly, Netflix attracted F1 fans without paying for expensive F1 rights.Now, Netflix has started working on DTS Season 6. They have also made documentaries on golf,tennis, NBA, NFL, etc.This Netflix’s Drive to Survive strategy: to attract sports fans, make shows about sports instead of paying for sports rights.It seems that Hotstar is following the same strategy.Hotstar knew that when they gave up IPL, they would lose a lot of subscribers.They lost 3.8 million subscribers immediately, and they are expected to lose upto 15M subscribers. Just from IPL.But Hotstar made the right decision: IPL rights are very expensive. Better to follow Netflix’s Drive to Survive strategy.Now, Hotstar is focusing on its own orignals. Last year, they announced that they are working on 100 new Hotstar Originals.Smart strategy, right?Follow Shreyans Singh for more insights like this.PS: I'm hiring for someone to help me research for my linkedin posts.

334,"Great rejoicings and festivities followed the return of Sri Rama to Ayodhya and his crowning as the King. Lord Rama distributed gifts to all the monkeys who had served as warriors in his army. Sri Rama noticed his fervent devotee, Hanumanji and asked:“O mighty hero how am I to compensate you for all you have done for me and my family?”Many would have wanted wealth, name or fame, approbation or recognition or VIP line in return for their services. But Sri Hanuman was above all these:“I desire nothing, Prabhu!”Then, Maa Sita removed a valuable necklace of pearls from her neck and offered it to the humble Sri Hanuman.Sri Hanuman received the necklace with great respect from Mata Sita, but began to break the pearls with His teeth.Sita, and other ministers who were sitting in the council-hall, were quite astonished at this queer act of Sri Hanuman. Some wondered why the noble and great warrior Sri Hanuman was behaving like a monkey. Was it the monkey mind?Sita asked Hanuman, “O mighty Hero! What are You doing? Why do You break the pearls?”Sri Hanuman said, “O venerable Mother! It is the most valuable necklace, indeed, as it has come to me through Thy holy hand. But I want to find out whether any of the pearls contains my beloved Lord Rama. I do not keep a thing devoid of Him. I do not find Him in any of the pearls.”At this, one of the assembly members ironically remarked, “You would not wear any thing that has not got in it the Name of Rama. Well, You are wearing your body. You are carrying it about with you. Prove to us that you have the Name in it.”Hanuman laughed aloud; he said, “I shall prove, See!”Sri Hanuman then tore his chest open with his mighty hands and Lo! Sri Rama and Maa Sita were seated in his heart!Lord Rama came down the throne and embraced Hanuman and blessed Him. He asked him, “Hanuman! What can I offer you on this occasion? I have no gift worthy to be given to you. I am giving you myself as my gift to you.” Then, he offered his body to be clasped by Hanuman’s hands. The assembly was moved into shouts of “Jai ho” at this unique act of Grace. They praised Hanuman and declared that there was no one to equal him in all the worlds. They praised the devotion and dedication of Hanuman.When Sri Rama ascended to His Supreme abode, Hanuman also wished to follow Him. But the Lord asked him to remain in this world as His representative, and attend the assemblies of saints where discourses (katha) on His deeds were held and heard, and help His devotees in cultivating devotion.Hanumanji is a Chiranjeevi (immortal). He is everywhere. He who has devotion beholds Him, and receives His blessing.#india #hanuman #hanumanji #hanumanchalisa #lordhanuman #sanatandharma"
