10,"My M.Tech research interview experience at Indian Institute of Science (IISc)Last year, I had the opportunity to attend the interview process of the M.Tech by Research programs at the CSA department at IISc.Firstly, for CSA, there are three pools to choose from -A. Theoretical Computer Science, consisting of Algorithms, TOC, graph theory and discrete math, cryptography and security, Approximation and randomization, geometry etc.,B. Computer Systems, consisting of operating system, architecture, compilers, computer security, high performance computing etc.,C. Intelligence Systems, consisting of machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics, reinforcement learning etc.I chose Pool C so, I was asked questions related to areas, ranging from basic data structures and programming skills to linear algebra and probability.Prepare from standard textbooks for whatever pool you are applying. Find related NPTEL videos on YouTube and try to understand the concepts well.For example, if you are appearing for pool C then, for Linear algebra you can refer to 3blue1brown or MIT Gilbert Strang lectures on Youtube. For Probability you can refer to Sheldon Ross textbook, etc.Some of the questions I remember were 1) given some constraints can you derive uniform distribution and find it's expectation? 2) Given system of equations with some constraints what kind of solutions they have?One of the most important things that they look for is a strong understanding of fundamental concepts. They are interested in your ability to apply your knowledge to real-life problems. Mathematics is a crucial part of these programs, so they expect a strong foundation in that. They want to see how well you can approach problems and arrive at solution.This is not about how many formulas you know or how many properties you can recite. They look for your thought process and approach to the problem. Even if you cannot solve a problem, they are interested in how you discuss and approach the problem with them. They might even provide you with hints and support your thought process.During the interview, I found that the faculties were flexible about the area in which I wanted to work. You can also discuss their research work and your interest.Here are some final tips to prepare for the interview process:1. Focus on your fundamentals and make sure you understand the underlying concepts clearly.2. Don't throw fancy keywords or concepts at the interview if you don't really understand them. For example ""deep learning and neural networks"" etc. unless you know them well with underlying math and how they work. They can easily tell if you are not being honest.3. You can visit google scholar profile of 2-3 professors under whom you want to work and know about their ongoing research. This can be strong and positive topic of discussion during interview.Good luck to all of you!#machinelearning #gate2023 #gatecse #iiscbangalore #mtech #research"

24,"The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.There is no realistic way to implement a moratorium and stop all teams from scaling up LLMs, unless governments step in. Having governments pause emerging technologies they don’t understand is anti-competitive, sets a terrible precedent, and is awful innovation policy. Responsible AI is important, and AI has risks. The popular press narrative that AI companies are running amok shipping unsafe code is not true. The vast majority (sadly, not all) of AI teams take responsible AI and safety seriously. Let's invest more in safety while we advance the technology, rather than stifle progress.A 6 month moratorium is not a practical proposal. To advance AI safety, regulations around transparency and auditing would be more practical and make a bigger difference."

Ich dürfte mit ca. 50 anderen Forumsbesuchern im IBM Headquarter D.A.CH. den einzigen deutschen Quantencomputer besuchen.Die simple Antwort auf die Frage, ob dieser Computer intelligent ist lautet: Wir denken noch zu linear. 🤯 Schon nach 2 Minuten merkte ich, wie groß meine Wissenslücke ist. Der super spannende Vortrag von Dr. Jan-Rainer Lahmann offenbarte mir das eindringlich. Folgende 3 Insights habe ich erstmal mitgenommen.✅ Der Quantencomputer ist nicht einfach ein besserer und schnellerer Rechner. Er/Sie/Es ist eine ganz neue Art der Informationsverarbeitung und Bereitstellung. Ich muss mich dringend mit den Grundlagen der Quantenphysik vertraut machen. Sonst verstehe ich das Potenzial eines Quantencomputers nicht. ✅ Im Gegensatz zum normalen Computer kennt er mehr als 2 Zustände. Diese liegen zwischen 0-1. Das ermöglicht parallele Berechnungen. Schrödingers Katze kann also wirklich gleichzeitig leben oder nicht leben. Und damit komme ich zum spannendste Faktor. ✅ Der Quantencomputer ist NICHT für rein logische Berechnungen da. Auf die Frage, ob Schrödinger's Katze lebt, kann er nach jeder Berechnung eine andere Antwort geben. Die immer ein etwas anderes Ergebnis bedeutet.🤷‍♂️ Ganz ehrlich. Ich hab es immer noch nicht verstanden. Aber ich weiß jetzt. Ich will es verstehen.Dank des Forum's habe ich nun direkten Zugang zu den Experten. Auch im Bereich #ai war Kenza Ait Si Abbou direkt zur Beantwortung meiner Fragen vor Ort. PS: Für alle die schon weiter sind als ich. Ihr könnt das Ding kostenlos über die IBM Cloud testen.https://lnkd.in/e_UuUrXg#ibmquantum #influencer #corporateinfluencer #ibm Und mein ganz persönlicher Dank gilt den Organisatoren:innen Petra Bernhardt, Jürgen Schmitt, Katrin-Cécile Ziegler und Daniel Unkelhäußer.

29,"📍Pandas is a popular data manipulation library in Python, but it has some limitations when it comes to handling very large datasets:1) Memory limitations: Pandas loads the entire dataset into memory, which can be a problem if the dataset is very large and exceeds the available memory on your machine. This can cause the program to crash or become unresponsive.2) Limited scalability: Pandas is designed to work on a single machine, which limits its ability to handle large datasets that require distributed computing across a cluster of machines.3) Limited parallelism: Pandas does not support parallel processing out of the box, which means that it cannot take advantage of multiple CPU cores or threads to speed up computations.PySpark, on the other hand, is a distributed computing framework that can handle large datasets by distributing the computation across a cluster of machines. Some of the benefits of using PySpark over Pandas include:1) Scalability: PySpark can scale to handle datasets that are too large for Pandas to handle on a single machine. It can distribute the computation across a cluster of machines, which allows it to handle datasets that are terabytes or petabytes in size.2) Fault tolerance: PySpark is designed to handle failures in a distributed environment. If a machine fails or becomes unresponsive, PySpark can automatically reassign the tasks to another machine, ensuring that the computation continues without interruption.3) Parallel processing: PySpark can take advantage of multiple CPU cores or threads to speed up computations. This can significantly reduce the time required to process large datasets.Overall, PySpark is a powerful tool for distributed computing and big data processing, which makes it a good alternative to Pandas when dealing with very large datasets that exceed the memory and processing power of a single machine.#datascience #dataengineering #machinelearning #datascientist"

It's important, very important. 💁🏽‍♂️A job offer is like a business deal.You help the company with your skills and expertiseand the company pays you for it. 🤝Hiring is extremely expensive for a company.The company wants you as much as you want that job, if not more.Adding a couple of lakhs is generally not a big deal for most companies.So never hesitate to negotiate, it's not a sin. 💁🏽‍♂️Read More about it from the link in the first comment. 👇and Remember,`If you're underpaid, It's YOUR fault.` 🤷🏽‍♂️Cheers,Akshay Saini"

In 2008, I started working on ways to bring Agile to enterprise IT teams and other non-software organizations. Since that time, I've seen most large companies pursue Agile, often setting goals to aggressively change the way they work. In the past few years, due to COVID, this has really accelerated, with many enterprise organizations trying to finally make Agile a reality. As that has happened, more are starting to question if that shift is worth it. In this post, I explore why this is and what the alternatives are. #softwaredevelopment #softwareengineering #agile #technology #enterprise #digital #BeCognizant #IntuitionEngineered"

62,"Most personal development advice isn't valid for women...Here are my top 10 personal development tips for women:1. Prioritize sleep: Getting 7-8 hours of sleep is a game changer if you're constantly feeling burned out. Reset your body first thing by making sleep a priority.2. The 5 am plan: The 5 am club has its benefits, but don't follow it blindly. If you're already struggling to sleep, waking up earlier won't help.3. Take care of your body: Don't push yourself too hard during workouts. Make sure to rest, recover, and take your supplements. Your body needs to be energized to get the most out of your workout.4. Meditate: You don't need to meditate for an hour to maintain your sanity. As a working woman, you already have a lot on your plate, especially if you have a family. Find what works for you and embrace the chaos. Even 10 minutes of quiet time every day can help you feel sane.5. Multitasking: Women have an innate ability to multitask, but be careful not to take on too many tasks at once. Try to limit yourself to 2-3 tasks at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.6. Write and plan: Dump all the information in your head somewhere other than your brain. Use post-its and planners to organize your day, week, month, or quarter. Meal planning can also help reduce weekly overwhelm and make grocery shopping easier. Notion is a great app I use to keep my life organized.7. Ask for help: Don't try to do everything alone. Asking for help from trusted people at work or home is a sign of strength, not weakness.8. Prioritize yourself: Don't always try to please others. Choose what is important to you and be diplomatic. Not every fight is worth fighting.9. Self-care: Pay attention to what your mind is craving and do it. Whether it's a night out with friends or a spa visit, prioritize self-care.10. Connect with other women: Strong connections with other women are essential for personal growth. Within your circle, you can be raw, vulnerable, strong, empathetic, and a complete fool yet feel safe and understood.#womenentrepreneurs #women #womenatwork"

109,"Building and scaling offline GT distribution is one of the most difficult things to achieve in the journey of building consumer brandsIn our journey of expanding our presence to 200+ cities & 15000+ stores, here are 3 unique things we did that helped us in the initial daysa) No Hard Sales Targets:Instead of having sales targets, we had targets on input metrics. For us, the most important metric was the number of counters visited every day and the quality of each visit.In the initial days, you will face rejection daily. And it is purely about perseverance. In the first couple of visits to big counters, the shop owner will not even speak with you. In the third visit, maybe he will offer you tea and understand about the product/brand. And maybe in the 4th/5th visit, he will give you the first order.And this behavior of the retailer is intentional to an extent. Sub-consciously he checks how serious the sales person is about building the brand. If the sales guy keeps visiting him continuously for weeks, there is a high chance that he will agree for the stock placementb) Leveraging Digital to build Retailer awareness:In each of our visits to the counters, we used to collect the business card of the shops. These business cards had the contact details of the retailers. We started creating custom audiences for the retailers and started running ads on all digital platforms.This made the brand and the product familiar to the retailers.In addition to normal feature/led ads, a lot of the ads were around awards/recognition that we had received. This built trust amongst retailersBrand Familiarity and Trust are the 2 things most critical to get a retailer to stock an early stage brand. This is why you would often hear legacy brands activating TV and Print ads to get trade to believe in the brand. But digital allows you to do the same in a much more cost effective and intelligent wayc) In Person Sellout:Placement for the first time is still relatively easier. But if the products don’t sell from the counters, the brand is dead and buried.To enable sellouts, I used to go and work as a shop boy in the top counters on weekends( high customer walk-ins). In addition to the obvious benefit of kickstarting sellout from the stores, this helped us in multiple ways:- When the retailer see you pitching the product, they get an understanding on what to communicate. Their training gets completed- It helps you get a lot of first hand consumer insights which are used to improve product & marketing communicationOver time, this got institutionalized and everyday our sales folks and all leaders in market visits interact and pitch to customers wherever possible.Building and scaling General Trade in India is tough. But then again, when was the last time you found something worth building which wasn't tough :)P.S. Old pic from one of the days when I was working as a shopboy :)"

For sure, the intention to infuse D&I is strong here, yet companies fall short from employees’ point of view leading to discrepancies. That’s why it’s better to evaluate employee’s job skills and EQ level to counter the situation.Learning #2 — Hiring based on IQ and EQ levelsWhen hiring someone, we look to grade their skills, but also look for indicators of the kind of human they are. We discuss each candidate with the panel for their perspectives.  Learning #3 — Providing opportunitiesIf there are people in the team who are ready to take on more responsibility, we promote a top performer instead of hiring someone new — you can say — we lateral hire employees from our internal teams. This helped boost employee’s morale and motivation leading to positive growth.We wrote a detailed report on this that highlights our 6 learnings.
