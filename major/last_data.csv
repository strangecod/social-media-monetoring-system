55,"I love this challenge coin my leaders Robert (Steve) Stoker and Anibal ""J.R."" Nieves at work gave us!Traditionally, challenge coins are given to service members and law enforcement personnel for achievement, recognition and morale. So in that same spirt we have been given this coin. You can see the Microsoft logo and the mission statement on the front. Then on the back the team I am apart of and the AD Ninja logo. This logo and idea came around internally around 6 years ago by highly esteemed colleague Justin Turner. The idea is that we are AD Ninjas fighting for our customers and colleagues on advisory, break/fix and disaster recovery of AD environments and to encourage continued AD learning. I actually created the artwork for the coin as one of my leaders reached out asking if I would like to assist in bringing the challenge coin idea to life. You may notice a misspelling which took place during the proofing process (I assure you all, in my artwork there were no misspellings) of the coin development which just makes this coin even more unique if you ask me. We all laugh about it now.It's great to work in an environment where you are appreciated! #Microsoft #MicrosoftEmployee #MicrosoftLife #ChallengeCoin #MoraleGift #Coin #Morale"

That’s why we are steadily working on creating the Metaverse with #Diversity, #Equity and #Inclusion in mind - because only  when everyone has an equal voice can we develop more inclusive products for people around the world. 🌍Research by McKinsey also proves women to be a driving force in implementing the #metaverse. It showed that female executives are 20% more likely to set up multiple metaverse initiatives than their male counterparts and that women overall are more likely to utilize hybrid use cases of the metaverse, such as gaming, live events, and shopping via AR/VR technologies. And as they illustrate so well, now it is time to increase the number of women in #leadership roles - across the metaverse and the entire industry. At Meta we doubled the number of women in our global workforce compared to 2019 and increased female leadership positions to a total of 37,1% - and we won’t stop there! 🚀Read more about our efforts to build an inclusive and equal metaverse: https://lnkd.in/eNXN5Ctf"

The reality now for me is I have started a journey finally embracing my bajan curls a curly head of hair that changes each day depending on the weather, the evening protective style, the finger detangle and my own mood!!For the first time thanks to my son educating me and the help of social media I embrace my curls I couldn’t pic a favourite curly picture so sharing a few Thank you LinkedIn and Dove I LOVE my curls and I will never pat them flat again #blackhairisprofessional"

The competition is open to undergrads and grad students at accredited colleges and universities across the Cascadia Corridor – Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia, as well as Alaska.The prototype uses a custom-built 3x3 sensor mat coupled with an accelerometer connected to an Adafruit ESP32 feather that maps the readings of the sensor matrix to a TFT screen and uploads the data to the cloud.

109,"Just wanted to put out my thoughts regarding relocation. I have been observing a trend of many companies offering remote roles while some companies are still asking employees to relocate. While there are pros and cons to both approaches, I just wanted to outline some of the struggles for a complete relocation from an employee point of view-1. Finding movers-  If the company provides relocation assistance great! , else you will need to get different quotes and start packing your stuff.  You will need to schedule movers and plan your travel accordingly.2. Finding a new place to live - Again, even with relo assistance it's hard to quickly find a new apartment or home which matches your criteria of no of bedrooms, parking spaces, yard etc  and it's more challenging if you are moving to a more expensive place. This is especially challenging if employer does not offer temporary housing. Plus additional hassle of selling or renting your current home as applicable. 3. Car shipping- Apart from the move you will need to find a good company to ship your cars. Some people employ a strategy to sell cars and buy new ones to prevent this.4. Social - You can always find new coworkers but it's hard to start making social connections from scratch. This becomes increasingly difficult as you get older. Social life may include work friends, yoga friends,  friends you take a walk with, friends you have coffee with, neighbours etc. Having this community around is extremely crucial for your mental health and overall well being. Building this back takes a lot of time. 5. Healthcare- Sometimes it may take months to find a good primary care physician in your insurance network, this also includes letting go of your favourite doctor or dentist and go through a gruelling find in another city or location. This is especially hard for people with health issues. 6. Kids or pets- Finding a good daycare or boarding for your pet, finding playdates for your kids, schooling change for kids, friends also would change for kids. This is a huge social challenge for the little ones. 7. Weather- When moving to a colder or hotter place, it takes time to acclimate to the weather.8.Misc- From redirecting mail to getting a new driver's license for the state, there are some additional misc items which need to be taken care of when moving. 9. Finding another/remote job for your spouse/ family member. From my perspective, this is a very long gruelling process and takes months if not years for someone to shift base completely. Is it really worth asking someone move and change their entire life? Wouldn't it be beneficial to the company if the employee instead works from their home and is productive immediately?What do you think? Should employers move to-1. Completely remote or 2. Keep it on site for jobs completely doable on a laptop. Do let me know in the comments! Also feel free to add if I've missed any points above. Thank you! 🙂"

Their profits in last quarter (not year, one quarter!) 2022: - Google: 40Bn$- Microsoft: 35Bn$- Amazon: 19.65Bn$ Important lessons if you are aiming for tier-1 jobs: [1] You are either a cost centre or profit centre to your firm. If you bring in 10L a year and get a salary of 8L, you will survive (if you are lucky), else you will not. [2] A good firm is a launchpad to better things. Not, the destination in itself. Don't get too cozy once you make it to the top firm. [3] A firm's cardinal goal is to look after its shareholders. And, your cardinal goal is to look after your career, very similar to how your CEO does. Brutal as it may sound: Team building exercises, dinners/lunches, over-arching visions of how the firm is changing the world are all theatrics that keeps you motivated to contribute to your firm. Nothing more. Don't lose sight of the fact that you are a one person army, who needs to look after your career."

159,"One of the best pieces of career advice I got in my early career is to “Talk to people”. I used to talk to people at very transactional levels especially when I had a job/an ask in my mind. This made me miss a larger opportunity to know about the problem that person is solving/working on. After getting that advice, I started asking out to people for a coffee chat, without any task in mind. It was super uncomfortable for me to start this. I had doubts/questions like what topic should I discuss, how to build the conversation, am I wasting his/her time, etc. Over a period, I started enjoying these conversations. It eventually became my habit. Lots of my learnings and exposure came from these casual chats. I got opportunities to work with a few great teams I never thought about. I identified use cases that I never believed existed. A few discussions stretched from 20 minutes to 1 hour and eventually became a lifelong connection.I felt like those discussions gave me more learning than reading a book. One simple thing that took me so long to understand. Now, I prefer taking an average course with great people to another way around. Talking to good people opens up far more opportunities than you believe. It’s a simple process: Discuss, experiment, reflect and repeat. Just keep exploring.#ExperienceFromTheField"

161,"So Hera Pheri 3 is finally happening! Look forward to being back on set with Pareshji & Akki. Like all good things, this one took some time, but it’s a relief to finally have an answer to this question! #Films are such a huge part of our culture, and yet, not many understand what goes into making a film. Apart from creative challenges, the #businessmodel & needs of the #movie business make it as challenging as any other.There are several factors for any business to succeed - a good idea, thorough market research, a solid business plan, a skilled team, funding at the right time & a strong distribution network.The movie business isn’t very different. To explain the entirety of the movie business here would be over simplifying it. But let's just say having a good script, a set of actors & a director is literally just the start point.There’s the #financing of a movie. It's usually #studios or #productionhouses, which invest their own #capital. Their teams assess the viability of a project before deciding on the budget.Some large films are financed through pre-sales and distribution deals, in which the distribution rights for the film are sold in advance to distributors and/or streaming platforms.Like the startup world, access to financing depends on the size of the film, as well as the connections & resources available to the producers & investors involved.Another key aspect in the movie business is #distribution. It’s a complex process that involves several layers like producers, distributors & exhibitors.Once a film’s made, a studio typically either sells the distribution rights to a distributor or appoints one on a commission basis, who is then responsible for securing screens from theatre owners, negotiating terms & releasing the film in theatres. Sometimes distributors negotiate a % of the box office collections.There are several other ways to monetise films.#BoxOffice collections, domestic & international, are the primary ones. Success depends on various factors, including the star cast, genre, music & the buzz created.Then come the #TV (satellite) & #OTT (digital) rights, which are a significant % of overall revenue. These deals can be fairly structured at times. Recently these values shot through the roof, but have become more rational off late.#MusicRights are another important source of revenue. Usually sold to a #musiclabel who in turn monetise it through channels like streaming, licensing, digital ad revenues etc.Many films also tie-up with #brands for in-film placements or co-marketing activities, as an additional layer of revenue, or sometimes to offset part of the pre release marketing expenses.There are so many other aspects that make the movie business challenging - audience preferences, data & insights, IP rights & licences, pre & post production, line production, permissions, promotions, pricing etc etc33 years & 125 films later I don’t have it all figured out, but I will keep getting better at it 🙏"

Sounds fancy. Let me break it down.→ Most brands will approach you once you cross 10,000 followers atleast → The desired commercial rate is (“number of followers”/2). → So, you’ll get around 3K-5K for one promotion. On an average students take around 6-10 months to build that kind of an audience. → So, time invested, 5.3 days/month * 6 = 31.8 Days→ You’re basically spending around a month’s time to even reach a level where you can get brand collabs.Well, if you spend this much time, day & night, learning a skill, it’ll give you returns way MORE than brand collabs and for way LONGER than just 1 post. 💸The point?Well, if you're posting on LinkedIn 'only' because you want to make money from brand collabs, you’re straight-up wasting your time. I couldn’t be more clear. Sorry.(You'll earn 10x from brand collabs on other platforms like Instagram & YT, trust me!)So, either rethink your business here, or save your time and learn something useful!Remember, spending the same time with the right strategy can give you 6-figures on LinkedIn, while you’re just stuck eyeing brand collabs!In fact, people who're making the most money out of brand collabs, their primary source of earning is not even collabs!Shall I let you in on a little secret?🤫I have 75,000+ followers and my income from brand collabs is at max 20% of my total income. Going by this percentage, you’re stuck making INR 200x from promotions when you can be making INR 800x.  Don't fool yourself. THINK PEOPLE THINK!Just because ChatGPT has made it easier to write content, it doesn't mean you'll do it without a strategy in place.

185,"My M.Tech research interview experience at Indian Institute of Science (IISc)Last year, I had the opportunity to attend the interview process of the M.Tech by Research programs at the CSA department at IISc.Firstly, for CSA, there are three pools to choose from -A. Theoretical Computer Science, consisting of Algorithms, TOC, graph theory and discrete math, cryptography and security, Approximation and randomization, geometry etc.,B. Computer Systems, consisting of operating system, architecture, compilers, computer security, high performance computing etc.,C. Intelligence Systems, consisting of machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics, reinforcement learning etc.I chose Pool C so, I was asked questions related to areas, ranging from basic data structures and programming skills to linear algebra and probability.Prepare from standard textbooks for whatever pool you are applying. Find related NPTEL videos on YouTube and try to understand the concepts well.For example, if you are appearing for pool C then, for Linear algebra you can refer to 3blue1brown or MIT Gilbert Strang lectures on Youtube. For Probability you can refer to Sheldon Ross textbook, etc.Some of the questions I remember were 1) given some constraints can you derive uniform distribution and find it's expectation? 2) Given system of equations with some constraints what kind of solutions they have?One of the most important things that they look for is a strong understanding of fundamental concepts. They are interested in your ability to apply your knowledge to real-life problems. Mathematics is a crucial part of these programs, so they expect a strong foundation in that. They want to see how well you can approach problems and arrive at solution.This is not about how many formulas you know or how many properties you can recite. They look for your thought process and approach to the problem. Even if you cannot solve a problem, they are interested in how you discuss and approach the problem with them. They might even provide you with hints and support your thought process.During the interview, I found that the faculties were flexible about the area in which I wanted to work. You can also discuss their research work and your interest.Here are some final tips to prepare for the interview process:1. Focus on your fundamentals and make sure you understand the underlying concepts clearly.2. Don't throw fancy keywords or concepts at the interview if you don't really understand them. For example ""deep learning and neural networks"" etc. unless you know them well with underlying math and how they work. They can easily tell if you are not being honest.3. You can visit google scholar profile of 2-3 professors under whom you want to work and know about their ongoing research. This can be strong and positive topic of discussion during interview.Good luck to all of you!#machinelearning #gate2023 #gatecse #iiscbangalore #mtech #research"

188,"The call for a 6 month moratorium on making AI progress beyond GPT-4 is a terrible idea.I'm seeing many new applications in education, healthcare, food, ... that'll help many people. Improving GPT-4 will help. Lets balance the huge value AI is creating vs. realistic risks.There is no realistic way to implement a moratorium and stop all teams from scaling up LLMs, unless governments step in. Having governments pause emerging technologies they don’t understand is anti-competitive, sets a terrible precedent, and is awful innovation policy. Responsible AI is important, and AI has risks. The popular press narrative that AI companies are running amok shipping unsafe code is not true. The vast majority (sadly, not all) of AI teams take responsible AI and safety seriously. Let's invest more in safety while we advance the technology, rather than stifle progress.A 6 month moratorium is not a practical proposal. To advance AI safety, regulations around transparency and auditing would be more practical and make a bigger difference."

Ich dürfte mit ca. 50 anderen Forumsbesuchern im IBM Headquarter D.A.CH. den einzigen deutschen Quantencomputer besuchen.Die simple Antwort auf die Frage, ob dieser Computer intelligent ist lautet: Wir denken noch zu linear. 🤯 Schon nach 2 Minuten merkte ich, wie groß meine Wissenslücke ist. Der super spannende Vortrag von Dr. Jan-Rainer Lahmann offenbarte mir das eindringlich. Folgende 3 Insights habe ich erstmal mitgenommen.✅ Der Quantencomputer ist nicht einfach ein besserer und schnellerer Rechner. Er/Sie/Es ist eine ganz neue Art der Informationsverarbeitung und Bereitstellung. Ich muss mich dringend mit den Grundlagen der Quantenphysik vertraut machen. Sonst verstehe ich das Potenzial eines Quantencomputers nicht. ✅ Im Gegensatz zum normalen Computer kennt er mehr als 2 Zustände. Diese liegen zwischen 0-1. Das ermöglicht parallele Berechnungen. Schrödingers Katze kann also wirklich gleichzeitig leben oder nicht leben. Und damit komme ich zum spannendste Faktor. ✅ Der Quantencomputer ist NICHT für rein logische Berechnungen da. Auf die Frage, ob Schrödinger's Katze lebt, kann er nach jeder Berechnung eine andere Antwort geben. Die immer ein etwas anderes Ergebnis bedeutet.🤷‍♂️ Ganz ehrlich. Ich hab es immer noch nicht verstanden. Aber ich weiß jetzt. Ich will es verstehen.Dank des Forum's habe ich nun direkten Zugang zu den Experten. Auch im Bereich #ai war Kenza Ait Si Abbou direkt zur Beantwortung meiner Fragen vor Ort. PS: Für alle die schon weiter sind als ich. Ihr könnt das Ding kostenlos über die IBM Cloud testen.https://lnkd.in/e_UuUrXg#ibmquantum #influencer #corporateinfluencer #ibm Und mein ganz persönlicher Dank gilt den Organisatoren:innen Petra Bernhardt, Jürgen Schmitt, Katrin-Cécile Ziegler und Daniel Unkelhäußer.

201,"To legal enthusiasts out there,Here is the compilation of 10 Most Important Judgments in IPR a law student must know. 1. Diamond v. Chakrabarty (1980) - This case established that genetically modified organisms are patentable subject matter under U.S. law.2. Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. (1984) - This case established the ""Betamax defense,"" which allows for the sale of devices with substantial non-infringing uses even if they can be used for infringing purposes.3. Diamond v. Diehr (1981) - This case established that computer software can be patentable subject matter under U.S. law if it provides a tangible and useful result.4. eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C. (2006) - This case established that an injunction is not always the appropriate remedy for patent infringement and that a court must consider the equitable factors of the case before granting an injunction.5. KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. (2007) - This case established that the obviousness of an invention must be considered in light of the prior art as a whole and that a combination of known elements may be considered obvious if it yields predictable results.6. Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International (2014) - This case established that abstract ideas implemented on a computer are not patentable subject matter under U.S. law.7. Novartis AG v. Union of India (2013) - This case involved a challenge to the patentability of a cancer drug and established that Section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act does not allow for the patenting of new forms of known substances unless they exhibit significantly improved efficacy.8. Golan v. Holder (2012) - This case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which restored copyright protection to works that had previously been in the public domain, and established that Congress has the power to restore copyright protection to works that have fallen into the public domain.9. Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. (2002) - This case established the doctrine of equivalents, which allows a patentee to claim infringement of a patent even if the accused product or process does not literally infringe the patent claims but is equivalent to them.10. Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. (2012) - This case involved a patent dispute between Apple and Samsung over smartphone technology and established that design patents can cover the ornamental aspects of a product, even if they are not essential to the product's function.I know, I’ve left behind many important judgements.

207,"In 2013, Buffer was struggling to grow its user base for its social media scheduling app. The company's co-founder, Leo Widrich, decided to reach out to users to get their feedback on the app.This is a stimulus.Every small feature you have developed goes for testing. Once the internal testing is done, there is external testing gets done by existing users or colleagues from a different field, etc.This happens whenever you push the code to production. Why?Taking a step back and deciding to talk to “non-tech” people, you understand the essential parts of the work you did, and how others are perceiving the work you do. You understand the real-world application of the technology that you have developed. As an engineer, your task is most often building the blocks. But when you take off your engineering hat, you see how people from other fields take the blocks that you have developed and make a use case that was never on your mind. So, Buffer’s founder started by asking a group of bloggers for their opinions on the app. One blogger told him that while she liked the idea of the app, she found it difficult to use and not intuitive. This feedback was surprising to him, as he had thought the app was user-friendly. You can just never know how changing the color of one button can make all the difference. Remember just because JSON is a cakewalk for you doesn’t mean it is for non-techies!When the “like” button came live, Facebook went through a phase when they were having a problem with the retention of the user. They couldn’t understand why they were failing even though they had a “like” button to make it engaging. After talking to some users, they understood that users didn’t want to “like” sad news, and this gave them so much insight. Hence, multiple reactions came into the picture. That’s why it becomes essential to talk to non-tech people to understand if what you think aligns with non-tech savvy. TL;DR -It provides perception It shows the knowledge gap.It is a way to make your technology more effective.It shows an enthusiasm in others to learn from you. This is an amazing boost to your confidence. Many times, you will find people listening to you like you are the absolute best in the industry. You might not be that person but since, you know your field, you are best at what you do. For a developer, it’s immensely necessary to understand what and how the world takes up space in the development world, and how you can take the space in the non-development world and learn from there!"

This can always be planned before or after the month- Organizing a team dinner during the month where everyone in the company can break-fast together- Every year, Muslims donate a certain proportion of wealth to charitable causes. Google has an employee program to match donations 1:1 as long as it is a registered charity.

234,"The most powerful quantum computer in Europe🇪🇺: potential for materials research, logistics and defenceA number of corporate influencers and thought leaders, including Yannick Fasters  and myself, had the opportunity to take a look at the highly complex system at the IBM Influencer Forum this week.The #IBMQuantum System One was ceremonially put into operation in 2021 in the presence of the then German Chancellor and Doctor of Physics Angela Merkel. Together with IBM, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft operates the quantum computer in Ehningen near Stuttgart. The special feature: All processed project and user data remain in Germany at all times and are subject to German data protection regulations. 👉😉 #dataprotection Today, the system is used by a large number of customers who want to explore the potential of this revolutionary technology for industrial use. Quantum physics will make things possible at the latest with the availability of a computer with a sufficient number of Qbits that would take an eternity with traditional computers or cannot even be calculated at all.The ultra-fast supercomputers, in combination with artificial intelligence, could create performance boosts for more value creation in the medium term. Dr. Jan-Rainer Lahmann mentioned medical technology, logistics and materials research as obvious examples of applications. For example, Volkswagen wants to use quantum computers on the one hand to develop new materials for car manufacturing, and on the other hand to simulate new urban traffic concepts for metropolises with millions of inhabitants.Experts also see the possibility of using quantum computers to stabilise critical security infrastructures, develop better algorithms for industrial production and better model battery and fuel cells.The computer in Ehningen contains 127 Qbits. If you were to order a quantum computer from IBM today, there would even be 433 quantum bits available in the Osprey system. Towards the end of the year, researchers expect a system with over 1000 quantum bits. That is a big leap forward in development. In 2018, these computers were still at 72 Qbits.Here are 10 quantum computing applications you should know about:👉Artificial intelligence👉Better batteries👉Cleaner fertilization👉Cybersecurity👉Drug development👉Electronic materials discovery👉Financial modelling👉Solar capture👉Traffic optimization👉Weather forecasting👉Climate changeThanks a lot to Petra Bernhardt, Daniel Unkelhäußer and the whole IBM team for this exciting journey into a technology that can shape the European ecosystem. #technology"

261,"#StoriesOfSupport“Last year was quite demanding yet rewarding for me. As part of my development goals I wanted to pursue further education. I discussed the same with my Manager (Ramneek Walia), and Skip Level Manager (Nihal Rajan) - both of them were so encouraging. I also consulted Kenneth Sequeira, ACC from L&D Team and got his full support to send in my application. I cleared the entrance test and received the offer to join the PGPEM (Executive MBA) from IIM Bangalore. Myntra helped me financially as well. There was no looking back. I never felt more empowered. My weekend classes started from April last year and today I have completed 4 semesters of the 2 year long course. Managing a full time job, family, and executive education is not easy. But it's impossible to do this without the encouragement and support of your managers, colleagues and family. I truly feel honoured and humbled to have such a support system, not only at home but also at work with my Myntra family!”- Nirajana AdhyaKnow more about #MyntraLife at: https://bit.ly/3LtjhER#MyntraLife #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2023 #IWD #MyntraForHer #WeForShe"

267,"Building and scaling offline GT distribution is one of the most difficult things to achieve in the journey of building consumer brandsIn our journey of expanding our presence to 200+ cities & 15000+ stores, here are 3 unique things we did that helped us in the initial daysa) No Hard Sales Targets:Instead of having sales targets, we had targets on input metrics. For us, the most important metric was the number of counters visited every day and the quality of each visit.In the initial days, you will face rejection daily. And it is purely about perseverance. In the first couple of visits to big counters, the shop owner will not even speak with you. In the third visit, maybe he will offer you tea and understand about the product/brand. And maybe in the 4th/5th visit, he will give you the first order.And this behavior of the retailer is intentional to an extent. Sub-consciously he checks how serious the sales person is about building the brand. If the sales guy keeps visiting him continuously for weeks, there is a high chance that he will agree for the stock placementb) Leveraging Digital to build Retailer awareness:In each of our visits to the counters, we used to collect the business card of the shops. These business cards had the contact details of the retailers. We started creating custom audiences for the retailers and started running ads on all digital platforms.This made the brand and the product familiar to the retailers.In addition to normal feature/led ads, a lot of the ads were around awards/recognition that we had received. This built trust amongst retailersBrand Familiarity and Trust are the 2 things most critical to get a retailer to stock an early stage brand. This is why you would often hear legacy brands activating TV and Print ads to get trade to believe in the brand. But digital allows you to do the same in a much more cost effective and intelligent wayc) In Person Sellout:Placement for the first time is still relatively easier. But if the products don’t sell from the counters, the brand is dead and buried.To enable sellouts, I used to go and work as a shop boy in the top counters on weekends( high customer walk-ins). In addition to the obvious benefit of kickstarting sellout from the stores, this helped us in multiple ways:- When the retailer see you pitching the product, they get an understanding on what to communicate. Their training gets completed- It helps you get a lot of first hand consumer insights which are used to improve product & marketing communicationOver time, this got institutionalized and everyday our sales folks and all leaders in market visits interact and pitch to customers wherever possible.Building and scaling General Trade in India is tough. But then again, when was the last time you found something worth building which wasn't tough :)P.S. Old pic from one of the days when I was working as a shopboy :)"

296,"Last year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won praise from the right for retaliating against Disney for its CEO’s decision to (rather timidly) wade into the public discourse over a contentious state law. In that first round of Florida’s GOP vs The Walt Disney Company, DeSantis landed a body blow that ultimately cost Disney CEO Bob Chapek his job.For DeSantis, a potential presidential contender in 2024, the standoff burnished his reputation on the right as a shrewd leader who won’t be easily pushed around, not even by one of the state’s largest employers.But now, in round two, DeSantis, age 44, is going up against longtime Disney boss Bob Iger, a Hollywood power player with decades more experience on the national stage. And Iger, at age 72, isn’t pulling any punches. Iger, who retired in 2020 only to return to the helm nearly three years later when Chapek was forced out (more on that later), doesn’t have much time to mess around. He’s given himself a two-year deadline to line up a successor, and he’s got to do that all while trying to reinvigorate a 100-year-old sprawling media conglomerate.Analysis by CNN's Allison Morrow"

363,"First-time homebuyers in America have never been older, and an influx of all-cash buyers, as well as a younger generation leaning financially on their parents for longer than ever before, has made it staggeringly difficult for older, lower-income renters to save enough for a home. In 2022, the typical American getting keys to a starter home was 36 years old, an all-time high, and many buyers are into their golden years before they can scrounge together a down payment.About 20% of buyers between the ages of 50 and 59 in 2022 were purchasing for the first time, according to Zillow’s Consumer Housing Trends Report. Eleven percent of buyers aged 60 to 69 were first-time homeowners, and among buyers over the age of 70, 7% were buying for the first time.For many of those buyers, the desire to lock in costs as they transition to a fixed income is reason enough to finally shift from renting to owning, said Jeff Tucker, a senior economist at Zillow. “As they’re considering how their pension, social security and income will be fairly fixed moving forward, the beauty of the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is that you don’t have to worry that rising rents could force you out,”  Zucker said."

394,"📍Pandas is a popular data manipulation library in Python, but it has some limitations when it comes to handling very large datasets:1) Memory limitations: Pandas loads the entire dataset into memory, which can be a problem if the dataset is very large and exceeds the available memory on your machine. This can cause the program to crash or become unresponsive.2) Limited scalability: Pandas is designed to work on a single machine, which limits its ability to handle large datasets that require distributed computing across a cluster of machines.3) Limited parallelism: Pandas does not support parallel processing out of the box, which means that it cannot take advantage of multiple CPU cores or threads to speed up computations.PySpark, on the other hand, is a distributed computing framework that can handle large datasets by distributing the computation across a cluster of machines. Some of the benefits of using PySpark over Pandas include:1) Scalability: PySpark can scale to handle datasets that are too large for Pandas to handle on a single machine. It can distribute the computation across a cluster of machines, which allows it to handle datasets that are terabytes or petabytes in size.2) Fault tolerance: PySpark is designed to handle failures in a distributed environment. If a machine fails or becomes unresponsive, PySpark can automatically reassign the tasks to another machine, ensuring that the computation continues without interruption.3) Parallel processing: PySpark can take advantage of multiple CPU cores or threads to speed up computations. This can significantly reduce the time required to process large datasets.Overall, PySpark is a powerful tool for distributed computing and big data processing, which makes it a good alternative to Pandas when dealing with very large datasets that exceed the memory and processing power of a single machine.#datascience #dataengineering #machinelearning #datascientist"

In 2008, I started working on ways to bring Agile to enterprise IT teams and other non-software organizations. Since that time, I've seen most large companies pursue Agile, often setting goals to aggressively change the way they work. In the past few years, due to COVID, this has really accelerated, with many enterprise organizations trying to finally make Agile a reality. As that has happened, more are starting to question if that shift is worth it.

420,"Most personal development advice isn't valid for women...Here are my top 10 personal development tips for women:1. Prioritize sleep: Getting 7-8 hours of sleep is a game changer if you're constantly feeling burned out. Reset your body first thing by making sleep a priority.2. The 5 am plan: The 5 am club has its benefits, but don't follow it blindly. If you're already struggling to sleep, waking up earlier won't help.3. Take care of your body: Don't push yourself too hard during workouts. Make sure to rest, recover, and take your supplements. Your body needs to be energized to get the most out of your workout.4. Meditate: You don't need to meditate for an hour to maintain your sanity. As a working woman, you already have a lot on your plate, especially if you have a family. Find what works for you and embrace the chaos. Even 10 minutes of quiet time every day can help you feel sane.5. Multitasking: Women have an innate ability to multitask, but be careful not to take on too many tasks at once. Try to limit yourself to 2-3 tasks at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.6. Write and plan: Dump all the information in your head somewhere other than your brain. Use post-its and planners to organize your day, week, month, or quarter. Meal planning can also help reduce weekly overwhelm and make grocery shopping easier. Notion is a great app I use to keep my life organized.7. Ask for help: Don't try to do everything alone. Asking for help from trusted people at work or home is a sign of strength, not weakness.8. Prioritize yourself: Don't always try to please others. Choose what is important to you and be diplomatic. Not every fight is worth fighting.9. Self-care: Pay attention to what your mind is craving and do it. Whether it's a night out with friends or a spa visit, prioritize self-care.10. Connect with other women: Strong connections with other women are essential for personal growth. Within your circle, you can be raw, vulnerable, strong, empathetic, and a complete fool yet feel safe and understood.#womenentrepreneurs #women #womenatwork"

For sure, the intention to infuse D&I is strong here, yet companies fall short from employees’ point of view leading to discrepancies. That’s why it’s better to evaluate employee’s job skills and EQ level to counter the situation.Learning #2 — Hiring based on IQ and EQ levelsWhen hiring someone, we look to grade their skills, but also look for indicators of the kind of human they are. We discuss each candidate with the panel for their perspectives.  Learning #3 — Providing opportunitiesIf there are people in the team who are ready to take on more responsibility, we promote a top performer instead of hiring someone new — you can say — we lateral hire employees from our internal teams. This helped boost employee’s morale and motivation leading to positive growth.We wrote a detailed report on this that highlights our 6 learnings.

It's not just the commitment to customers I see, but the stories I hear about how our employees have been able to succeed and thrive at Amazon. I had the chance to meet Vaishakhi Nanavati at TEB9, one of our operations sites in Somerset, New Jersey, in January. Vaishakhi's story is pretty incredible. She emigrated from India to the United States two years ago—and lucky for us, accepted a job working with Amazon. Vaishakhi told me about her journey of starting out working mostly nights, and really thriving as she learned about how we deliver packages to customers. A few months into her role, Vaishakhi found a mentor in TEB9 Senior Operations Manager, Jessie Bixby, and six months later was promoted to Process Assistant. But the story doesn’t end here. Thanks to Amazon's Career Choice program, which offers employees pre-paid education and skills training, Vaishakhi has started working toward a college degree (majoring in Business Administration) and is also taking ESL classes to help improve her English. Vaishakhi, your determination is inspiring—and I'm excited to hear about your continued success at Amazon."
555,"I am thrilled to share that I have taken up a new position as Engineering Lead - Backend at inFeedo. Special thanks to Varun Puri & Akshay Rastogi for giving me high hopes to be able to make this switch. Also Richa Anchan & Abha Khurana for this smooth transition.I want to take this moment to reflect back on my 4.9 years of journey at StoryXpress, it was a tremendous ride. I joined the company when there were just 4 people working, CEO, CTO and another techy, when we had a single product. Today, I can proudly say I was a part of that journey where the company grew to 30 people and 6 products today. It was an insane ride filled with its ups and downs. Special thanks to Chinmay Jindal & Ankit Mishra, for being the best people to work for & with, and keep me all motivated and running through these years. The trust and faith they showed in a newly graduated guy was immense and I did everything in my power to keep that intact. Another person I would highly appreciate is Varanasi Shashank, he was one of the best colleagues to work with. Always standing by the side, fuel to my engine, and help me motor the ideas and products throughout these years. Special thanks to Virendra Pratap, Jibin Joseph, Aman Kumar, Tamana M., Kashish Behl, Himanshu Kumar Das, Sameen Ahmad, Dhawal Singh P., Aradhya Trivedi, Yash Panchal, Jeel Bhavsar, Prateek Chouhan and many others who have over the years supported and encouraged me throughout my time with the company. I will always be very grateful to you guys for being there in this journey and giving me the lifetime of experiences.StoryXpress taught me a lot of things, one of those is ""Things can go to ashes, but never lose the trust in you, if you trust yourself everything can get right back"". I wish all the very best to the team at StoryXpress to do wonders and keep breaking those barriers. You will be very close to my heart. :)To the new beginning!!  🎉"

565,"Quoting John Quincy Adams, ex-US president, ""Successful leaders inspire others to learn more, do more and become more"". Being in this industry for more than 2 decades now, I was fortunate to be around and work with many such inspiring leaders. It has kept the fire in me going and always aspiring for the next challenge. But what happened last few weeks is something that I had not even dreamt of. So, here is what happened. I was announced as one of the finalists for ""Inspire"" category for this year's ADV D India Awards. This is an individual award that celebrate women who challenge the status quo of technology. From the time of announcement of finalists, wishes poured in from all around. I felt overwhelmed with so many calls and pings from Siemens colleagues with whom I had hardly interacted. I had never realized that my work or coaching initiative or even the little talks in different Siemens events had such a great influence and gained me supporters / well wishers from all Siemens ADV D India locations. It sounded like everyone (except me) were confident that I would win the award. And guess what, I did win :). Up until then, I had the feeling of impostor syndrome, always thinking that I was lucky to succeed or things just worked in my favor. But this time, I had to really give credit to myself. It would be impossible to pass through all the levels of juries with just luck. What made the award even more special is when my manager Chethan Seegehalli, peers and team cheered and celebrated my win, when our CEO Pankaj Vyas said ""Well deserved"". So, here i am proudly talking about my win (getting comfortable with the uncomfortable feeling of talking about myself) as this one is special :)"

576,"Flipkart is not laying off its employees. Read that again! Flipkart is NOT laying off its employees! Sounds strange considering the news that’s all around us, isn't it? 👀Recently, Krishna Raghavan, the Chief people officer at Flipkart said and I quote, “.. there are no mass layoffs happening at Flipkart.”This brings us to an important question. When the biggest tech giants of the world are struggling in this time of turmoil, what different has Flipkart done to retain its talent?Here are 3 strategies that have worked in Flipkart’s favour so far:1️⃣ Prioritising responsible hiring:Unlike many of its competitors in the tech and IT services sector, Flipkart is not using ""over-hiring"" as a justification for layoffs. The company states that they do not hire thousands and then resort to extreme measures to reduce headcount.2️⃣ Facilitating internal mobility:Flipkart understands that monotony and lack of lateral movement lead to a large chunk of employees quitting their jobs. To optimise its hiring efforts, Flipkart has lately increased internal job postings against hiring from the industry.This helps employees already acquainted with the company to move to different job roles of their choice. It increases the overall efficiency of the company while saving them a lot on hiring processes.3️⃣ Generous employee stock options:In November 2022, Flipkart went for an ESOP buyback plan of $700 million and also gave an increment to over 4000 senior managers to bring in pay parity within the company. Flipkart has now become one of the very few startups in India where ESOPs actually turn into liquidation opportunities for employees.Overall, Flipkart's approach to talent management demonstrates true commitment to responsible hiring & providing growth opportunities for its employees, even in times of uncertainty. ✨Such stories are rare to find in these times of turmoil and ought to be shared!

And to our many customers and partners around the world, I look forward to hearing what you think of our new offerings.  https://lnkd.in/gnKZ8hA6 #HPEStorage #innovation #team #data"

610,"Last week, my team (Meta Brands & Marketing Legal) had its first in-person onsite since the start of the pandemic, and I can't express how energized and grateful I am to have seen my colleagues from across the US, APAC & EMEA.It's been a challenging few years, with remote work becoming the norm and in-person interactions (the non-VC kind) few and far between. But getting the chance to see everyone face-to-face, catch up on work and life, and collaborate on projects in person was truly invigorating.There's just something special about being in the same physical space as your teammates.  I'm fascinated by the prospects of the metaverse and having tried it, it is quite compelling and getting better and better each day.  But in person time is absolutely special!  Not only did it make communication and collaboration more seamless, it also fostered a stronger sense of camaraderie and team spirit that's hard to replicate virtually.  We were able to have spontaneous meetings and breakout sessions, grabbed lunch and coffee together to build trust and bond, and engaged in team-building activities that simply couldn't be done over video.While I enjoyed all our team programming and learned tons throughout from my amazing teammates, my favorite part of our onsite was the visit to and volunteer work at the Ecumenical Hunger Program of East Palo Alto (www.ehpcares.org), where we helped stock shelves and distribute food to those in need in our surrounding community. 🙏🏼   A close second favorite moment was Lauren Tang and I celebrating our 10th work anniversaries, or as we call it, Metaversaries (and the team gifting me an amazing personalized Arsenal F.C. jersey 🏆 ).  Some fun pictures attached. Overall, I feel incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to reunite with the team in person. It's reminded me of the importance of human connection and collaboration, and I'm looking forward to more in-person gatherings in the future.  Thank you, BAM team, for making this time so memorable and meaningful.  Til next time...With Lauren Tang, Scott Minden, Austin Phillips, Renee Keen, Paul H. Sousa, Mick Stewart, Rich Daniels, Esther Ono, Paige Stapleton, Meghana B., Alistair Taylor, Jennifer Okafor, James Farris, Jen Fryhling, Nakia Cunningham, Varty H., Michelle Manahan, Eileen Fong, Allison Raines.#meta #legal #thankyou #teambuilding #community #volunteer"

636,"Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.Augmented reality is used to either visually change natural environments in some way or to provide additional information to users. The primary benefit of AR is that it manages to blend digital and three-dimensional (3D) components with an individual's perception of the real world. AR has a variety of uses, from helping in decision-making to entertainment.AR delivers visual elements, sound and other sensory information to the user through a device like a smartphone or glasses. This information is overlaid onto the device to create an interwoven experience where digital information alters the user's perception of the real world. The overlaid information can be added to an environment or mask part of the natural environment. #augmentedreality"

Tout ce que tu dois savoir des récentes actualités à ne pas manquer 👇🎨 Epic Games repousse les limites de Fortnite avec l'Unreal Editor. Cette intégration permet désormais aux joueurs de créer des expériences plus immersives et personnalisées qu'auparavant, renforçant la position de Fortnite comme plateforme créative. Maximiser l'interopérabilité entre les moteurs de rendu et proposer un meilleur partage de revenus avec les créateurs semblent être au cœur de ce nouveau dispositif, qui pourrait bien bouleverser la ""creator economy"". 🔫 Après des semaines de teasing, Valve corporation ""surprend"" avec l'annonce de CS 2 prévu pour cet été ! Le ""CS:GO killer"" fait déjà parler de lui, et les retours semblent unanimes : la communauté attend de pied ferme cette mise à jour. Preuve à l'appui : l'annonce a permis à la licence de battre son record de joueurs simultanés sur Steam, avec un pic atteignant 1 519 457 joueurs. 📉 Selon le SELL - Syndicat des Éditeurs de Logiciels de Loisirs, le marché français du jeu vidéo connaît une baisse de son chiffre d'affaires en 2022, avec 5,5 milliards d'euros (-1.6% par rapport à 2021). Cette baisse s'explique notamment par la crise économique que nous rencontrons actuellement, ou encore la pénurie de composants impactant sensiblement les ventes de consoles et autres périphériques. Une baisse relative, qui permet surtout de souligner la résilience de l'industrie en ces temps compliqués. 🌐 CCP Games, développeur du célèbre jeu EVE Online, sécurise 40 M$ de financement pour développer un nouveau jeu basé sur la technologie Web3.

672,"The holy place of Amarnath!The holy shrine of Amarnath Temple, is located at an elevation of 3,888 meters approx, about 29 kilometers from Pahalgam. Inside the cave is a Shiva Lingam made of ice considered to be the most holy symbol by devotees all across the globe. Devotees visit it in large numbers from June to August, with the pilgrimage tour famously known as Amarnath Yatra, which begins from Chandanwari. It is considered to be one of the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas, or the holiest shrines in Hinduism. The place where the Amarnath Cave stands today is the same place where Lord Shiva explained the meaning of life and eternity to his consort & wife, Goddess Parvati. Bhrigu Muni, a famous sage in Hinduism, was the first person to have discovered this holy site. At that time, the entire Kashmir Valley was submerged under water, and Kashyap Muni, another powerful sage, drained the waters with his divine powers. As the waters cleared, Bhrigu Muni was the first person to have the site of the Shiva Lingam.In 1989, pilgrims numbered between 12,000 and 30,000. In 2011, the numbers reached a peak, crossing 6.3 lakh (630,000) pilgrims. In 2018 pilgrims numbered 2.85 lakh (285,000). The annual pilgrimage has varied between 20 and 60 daysThank you for sharing Gauranga Das #india #lordshiva"

Going from a single night to do a college project to a full fledged product with a team of incredible people has been an incredible transition!

The real logic is written before you code. Sometimes, coding is the easiest part. 4. Understand your team’s software development life cycle. It helps greatly to plan out your tasks and deadlines. 5.

But then, even after these struggles, I always found ways to make it work.Everything is about your perception!If you think the glass is half empty, then it will always remain empty for you but if you think it is half filled, it will always remain filled for you. Being optimistic in life and especially in the corporate world is extremely important. I've had ample amounts of failures in my life. Starting from college to corporate life. But even after that, I cracked the interviews for Microsoft  & Google .There were many ups and downs, but I never took them negatively. Yes, they sometimes did demotivate me. But I always found my way out. If you look at it positively, you'll always take it as a learning and find success at the end.

Le fait qu’il ne se pratique qu’à l’extérieur permet aussi de s’aérer l’esprit. ✅ La déconnexion : L’avantage du golf c’est qu’il se joue souvent dans des cadres agréables, en pleine nature, parfait pour se couper de tout, se vider la tête et avoir l’esprit clair quand on se remet au boulot.✅ Le renforcement des relations sociales : Le golf est souvent joué en groupe, on discute, on se conseille, on se challenge, on rencontre du monde… Et à la fin de la partie, on boit un coup ensemble ! Alors oui, on termine rarement en sueur après une partie de golf. Mais c’est un sport qui nécessite un effort physique et mental qui croyez-moi vous épuise tout autant !Etant de nature très impatient et irrégulier dans mes efforts, ce sport m’a beaucoup aidé à améliorer ces axes là et à retranscrir ces améliorations dans ma vie perso et dans mon travail 💻Comme le dit si bien Bob Toski :“𝘓𝘦 𝘨𝘰𝘭𝘧 𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘶𝘯 𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵 𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘪𝘧𝘪𝘲𝘶𝘦 𝘲𝘶𝘪 𝘴𝘦 𝘫𝘰𝘶𝘦 𝘷𝘪𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘮𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘥𝘦 𝘭’𝘪𝘯𝘵é𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘶𝘳.”Et vous, avec quel sport est-ce que vous vous challengez ?

785,"New Updates from LinkedIn LinkedIn partners with Microsoft Entra to introduce a unique manner to verify your workplace. 😍 To beat the stress of identifying genuine LinkedIn profiles, the professional social media platform have rolled out new tools to prove where you work. 😊 LinkedIn have announced amazing set of verification features, enabling users to authenticate their identities and job history. 🙂 If someone tries to replicate a LinkedIn account, you'll find clear differences between the imposter account and the verified profile. 🌸 LinkedIn users around the world can verify their place of work via company email. Moreover, LinkedIn verification process doesn't include paid subscriptions or blue check mark. ☺️ To confirm your place of work, you need to enter a verification code sent to your company email address.🥰 By looking at verified LinkedIn profiles, organisations will become more confident that the people they collaborate with are authentic and that work affiliations are accurate. I hope that this new update will bring a positive impact in networking. #contentwriter #socialmedia #linkedin #digitalmarketing #branding #update #linkedinforcreators #networking #contentmarketing #microsoft #future #job #work #email"
786,"On a recent flight from Singapore to Delhi, I found an interesting thing!When looking for seats, I observed that the rightmost seats have letter designations GHJ, skipping the letter ‘I’. I was wondering why is it so?After some Google search, what I found out was interesting. It is because each seat has a row number followed by a letter; letters that may be confused with numbers (I, O, Q, S, or Z) must be avoided, usually for people with dyslexia. The Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was the first to implement this, avoiding I (1), O (0) and S (5). The remaining letters are called the DEC alphabet.Also, some airlines may skip some letters because some of the letters are absent from their alphabet (e.g. an airline in Vietnam may have the layout ABC-DEG-HKL in economy class because letters f, j, w, and z are absent from the Vietnamese alphabet). Occasionally, aircraft with a seating structure of 2+2 may letter the seats as ""ACDF"" to keep with the standard of A/F being window and C/D being aisle on short-haul aircraft (which generally have 3+3 seats).Some airlines omit the row number 13, reputedly because of a widespread superstition that the number is unlucky!Connect/Follow Nishant Kumar for more interesting facts around Tech, Product, Business, Culture, B-Schools, and others!"

815,"A friend recommended me a Netflix series “The Playlist”. It is a fictional series based on how Spotify came into existence. It might be fiction, but the tech about Spotify in it is real and it blew my mind.1. The CEO Daniel Ek, asked the former CTO Andreas Ehn to make Spotify as fast as possible. He wanted the song load time after click to be <200 ms which is perceivable by the human ear as instantaneous. This in itself is a great challenge in 2006. But, there was more to it. 2. They were losing money and couldn’t afford to have more servers. So Daniel asked Andreas to build a peer-to-peer network. But, with that, the search and playback would become extremely slow. The two things just do not match.3. The engineers still had to come up with a solution. They came up with a hybrid approach. Most of the time, they could predict what the user would want to listen to next and that song could be prefetched before the user even plays it themselves. And this prefetching would happen through the peer-to-peer network.4. But, 10% of the time, the user might want something different. If I consider myself, I listen to a wide range of song genres from Coldplay to Linkin Park to AP Dhillon. So, for this 10% of the time, the search instead of going to the peer-peer network would go on to the servers. This decreases the load on the servers by 90%. And the songs which were related are played instantaneously.5. I wanted to know if this is real or not. Turns out, it is. There is a Spotify research paper that talks exactly about this. They also talked about how they built this peer-to-peer network and even introduced a new protocol to achieve 245 ms playback latency.6. Now, for you try this. Open Spotify. Play a song. You would realize how fast the playback is after the click on any song you search.7 They clubbed this with client-level caching so that the more played songs can be loaded from the client itself. This cache also acts as a source for the peer-to-peer network. To optimize it even more, when your song is about to end(~30 s). They start prefetching the next song to play. The delay between the songs played is also extremely less.Looking from the top, Spotify looks like just a simple app playing songs stored in a database. But, the engineering effort that went into creating it is just tremendous.I created a video on this on my youtube channel. Do give it a watch to understand this in a better way along with some scenes from the series:https://lnkd.in/gJYyjqZ4Link to research paper in the video description."

823,"Imagine leaving a 30 lakh package salary & then starting a samosa business. And then, building a startup out of it with a turnover of 45 crores.😲I don’t think we need to imagine because Nidhi Singh & Shikhar Veer Singh made it a reality when they started the startup ""Samosa Singh” in 2015.But is that all?I have witnessed that whenever a startup is built out of passion & not greed, it is bound to fly high.Shikhar Veer Singh was so much in love with samosa that he sold his house worth 80 lakhs to re-invest the money in increasing the kitchen space. Some might say it is ridiculous, but that is exactly what passion makes you do.Today after following their passion they are making 12 lakhs per day which is way more than their 9 to 5 job salary.🚀Shikhar was a former principal scientist at Biocon & Nidhi a former employee at a pharma company.Despite having a nice comfortable life filled with luxury, they choose to start from scratch & hustle. And honestly, more than chasing money, the hustle is more attractive for successful entrepreneurs. They started cold calling & that is how they got their corporate orders. Moreover, they kept the price affordable.💵Rs 20/plate of aloo samosas (two pieces) & Rs 55/plate of chicken makhani samosa.This increased their demand for samosa all the more. Today this venture named WoknStove Foodworks Pvt Ltd under the brand SAMOSA SINGH has 40 outlets across India.We all talk about doing what we love but only a few take a step forward & work on it.The other day I was reading the news and I found this story from TOI. It said that the idea for selling samosas came to Shikhar when he was studying. But, keeping society's norms in mind and the degrees he had, he chose to become a scientist.  Here are a few takeaway lessons:✅No matter what there is no shame in following your passion.✅You don’t always have to build something from scratch. Like- samosa is an existing product in the market. They just created a new segment that served hygienic samosas.✅Turning your life partner into a business partner can be fruitful. I relate to this a lot. As Mayank Pratap Singh & I did the same.✅Hitting the Indian market with affordable prices is the best way to attract consumers.Do you have any other takeaways from this startup success story?#startupsuccess #indianstartups #founder #entrepreneurship"

831,"Great rejoicings and festivities followed the return of Sri Rama to Ayodhya and his crowning as the King. Lord Rama distributed gifts to all the monkeys who had served as warriors in his army. Sri Rama noticed his fervent devotee, Hanumanji and asked:“O mighty hero how am I to compensate you for all you have done for me and my family?”Many would have wanted wealth, name or fame, approbation or recognition or VIP line in return for their services. But Sri Hanuman was above all these:“I desire nothing, Prabhu!”Then, Maa Sita removed a valuable necklace of pearls from her neck and offered it to the humble Sri Hanuman.Sri Hanuman received the necklace with great respect from Mata Sita, but began to break the pearls with His teeth.Sita, and other ministers who were sitting in the council-hall, were quite astonished at this queer act of Sri Hanuman. Some wondered why the noble and great warrior Sri Hanuman was behaving like a monkey. Was it the monkey mind?Sita asked Hanuman, “O mighty Hero! What are You doing? Why do You break the pearls?”Sri Hanuman said, “O venerable Mother! It is the most valuable necklace, indeed, as it has come to me through Thy holy hand. But I want to find out whether any of the pearls contains my beloved Lord Rama. I do not keep a thing devoid of Him. I do not find Him in any of the pearls.”At this, one of the assembly members ironically remarked, “You would not wear any thing that has not got in it the Name of Rama. Well, You are wearing your body. You are carrying it about with you. Prove to us that you have the Name in it.”Hanuman laughed aloud; he said, “I shall prove, See!”Sri Hanuman then tore his chest open with his mighty hands and Lo! Sri Rama and Maa Sita were seated in his heart!Lord Rama came down the throne and embraced Hanuman and blessed Him. He asked him, “Hanuman! What can I offer you on this occasion? I have no gift worthy to be given to you. I am giving you myself as my gift to you.” Then, he offered his body to be clasped by Hanuman’s hands. The assembly was moved into shouts of “Jai ho” at this unique act of Grace. They praised Hanuman and declared that there was no one to equal him in all the worlds. They praised the devotion and dedication of Hanuman.When Sri Rama ascended to His Supreme abode, Hanuman also wished to follow Him. But the Lord asked him to remain in this world as His representative, and attend the assemblies of saints where discourses (katha) on His deeds were held and heard, and help His devotees in cultivating devotion.Hanumanji is a Chiranjeevi (immortal). He is everywhere. He who has devotion beholds Him, and receives His blessing.#india #hanuman #hanumanji #hanumanchalisa #lordhanuman #sanatandharma"

So, I focused on specific roles and took time off to recharge.After chatting with some great teams, I decided to sign an exciting new leadership role with Uber. That was back in January, which gave me and my family time to prepare for a big move from our small Kibbutz in Israel to the Big 🍎 However, just a couple of days ago, after discussing move details with my recruiter and completing all pre-employment tasks, I received a call saying that my new role had been rescinded due to internal restructuring.I was devastated.To put things in context–We were all ready to move, my wife quit her Impactful position, we off-boarded our kids from school, rented our house, and of course invested a large amount of time and money into the move. But worst, mentally we were already there.Despite this setback, I refuse to let it define me. I'm using this as an opportunity to grow, learn, and adapt.

To find answers to this vexing issue, one will have to delve deep into Insolvency law and the Companies Act. It will also involve recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act. Supreme Court in its judgment in DCM Financial  Services Ltd v. Neel Kamal Plastics Ltd, has ruled that the proceedings for liquidation of a company under the Companies Sct are not the same as an inter partes suit for recovery of money. In a money suit it may indeed be open to the plaintiff to accept any money outside the court from or on behalf of the defendant towards the full or partial satisfaction of his claim in the suit and to report the payment to the court for passing appropriate orders.But such is not the position in a proceeding for liquidation  of the company.Pooja Khandelwal ( Advocate ) Supreme Court of India #india #supremecourtofindia #lawyerlife #lawstudents #lawfirm #lawyersofinstagram #lawsuit #nclat #lawyers #law #lawyer #legal #lawfirm #lawyerlife #lawyersofinstagram #attorney #lawschool #attorneys #lawstudent #justice #advocate #supremecourt #lawstudents #legalnews #lawyering #court #personalinjury #attorneyatlaw #litigation #indianlaw #clat #lawyerslife #highcourt #advocates #legalupdates #judiciary #lawyerstyle #familylawattorney"

896,"Where and why are the #datastructures and #algorithms used? Part-2🎯𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐮𝐞𝐬: Queues are used for managing processes that need to be executed in a specific order, such as print jobs or network requests. They are also used in algorithms that require breadth-first search or other graph traversal algorithms. 🤔 👩‍💻Queues have a 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕-𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒙𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝒐𝒇 𝑶(1) for enqueue and dequeue operations, making them an efficient data structure for managing operations in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.🚀𝑷𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝑼𝒔𝒂𝒈𝒆: In a restaurant ordering system, a queue can be used to manage orders placed by customers. Each order can be added to the end of the queue, and when the kitchen is ready to prepare a new order, the order at the front of the queue can be removed and prepared.🎯𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐬: Trees are used for hierarchical data structures, such as directory structures, organisation charts, and decision trees. They are also used in algorithms that require efficient searching and insertion operations, such as balanced binary search trees. 🤔 👩‍💻Trees have a time complexity of O(log n) for search, insert, and delete operations in a balanced tree, making them efficient for applications that require these operations.🚀𝑷𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝑼𝒔𝒂𝒈𝒆: In a file system, a tree can be used to represent the directory structure of files and folders. Each node in the tree represents a file or folder, and the links between nodes represent the parent-child relationships between them; Trees are widely used in databases to efficiently store and retrieve data. The most common use of trees in databases is in the form of B-trees and their variants, which are specialised trees designed for use in databases. B-trees are used to index data in databases, allowing for fast searches and retrievals of data. They are particularly useful for storing large amounts of data that can't fit entirely in memory, as they minimise disk reads by reducing the number of disk blocks that need to be accessed.🎯𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐬: Graphs are used for modelling relationships between objects, such as social networks, road networks, and computer networks. They are also used in algorithms that require graph traversal and shortest path algorithms. 🤔 👩‍💻 Graphs can have varying time complexities for operations depending on the specific algorithm used, but in general, they have a time complexity of O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices (users) and E is the number of edges (connections) in the graph.🚀𝑷𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝑼𝒔𝒂𝒈𝒆: To model the relationships between users of social networks; to model road networks in navigation applications such as Google Maps; Recommendation Systems: Each user and item is represented as a node, and the links between nodes represent user-item interactions or preferences. Graph algorithms can be used to generate recommendations for users based on their interactions with items and the interactions of other similar users."

905,"Today, Expedia Group announced the launch of a new in-app conversational trip-planning experience powered by ChatGPT. The app integration (currently in beta for iOS) takes the manual details out of trip planning, letting Expedia members start an open-ended conversation as they imagine their next travel experience. I am incredibly excited that this experience also brings in intelligent shopping by automatically saving hotels discussed in the conversation to a “trip” in the app. Our teams continue to innovate and find ways to integrate AI and ML throughout the platform, creating more seamless experiences from planning to post-booking. I can’t wait to hear what you think about this new development.#chatgpt #traveltech #AI"

915,"I recently visited Kolkata to meet a client who was not very familiar with Influencers.The client we onboarded has always been using traditional methods like billboards and tv ads to do advertising. At the first meeting, they asked me, “What set procedure do you follow while selecting influencers? This is what I replied, There are several ways brands often look for creators : ✔ They may search for creators on various social media platforms using location, hashtags and keywords. ❌ But this will result in a huge pool of potential creators making it difficult to narrow down. It also makes understanding the audience difficult. ✔  A popular option is influencer marketing which provides a database of creators and tools for discovering and managing campaigns.❌  The data provided does not go beyond quantitative metrics like followers, views and likes.✔ Trusting their network, brands may ask other creators, industry experts, or customers for referrals or recommendations.❌ This will result in a limited pool of creators, and not all of them may be the right fit for the brand.✔  Brands look for reliability in creator partnerships, which represent a network of creators and offer campaign management services.❌ This gets very expensive, making it difficult for small brands to afford.While the above can help identify potential creators but are not enough to choose the right one. Here is what can be done: 🔸  No one understands their audience beyond their location and gender, so go beyond factors like engagement rate and shares. 🔸  To understand your audience, prompt genuine conversations with them and understand them accurately. 🔸  Understand what they like, think about, their affordability and who they are in the real world. They are consumers you target when doing a campaign. Why not take a step ahead and understand them better?  💭 By taking this step, brands can partner with creators who are a good fit for their campaign and discover hidden gems in achieving their goals including sales.If you’re a brand and want to explore influencer marketing campaign, reach out to us at @socialTag Or write to me at anushree@socialtagindia.com#influencermarketing #brands"

968,"When it comes to tax-saving options, businesses have a wider range of choices compared to salaried individuals. One option is to pay reasonable salaries to family members who work for the business (up to the basic exemption limit), and such salaries can be deducted from the taxable income of the business. This ultimately reduces the overall tax liability of the business, and since the salary is under the basic exemption, individuals do not need to pay any tax.Another option available to taxpayers is to form a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF). By forming an HUF, the business profits can be distributed among the members, which reduces the overall tax liability. However, it is important to ensure that the HUF is formed for genuine reasons and not merely for tax-saving purposes.Discover the additional tax-saving option we shared in our recent reelhttps://lnkd.in/dS5zwHsU"

The workshop aimed to educate the women employees of the mill. Following the workshop, our team discovered a few key insights. 1. Many of the women participants were interested in learning more about UPI as they were currently paying 1-1.5% commission to third parties when transferring money to their families in their native places, resulting in an annual expenditure of approximately Rs 970. 2. While 21% of the participants had the necessary resources to use UPI, they had concerns about its security. 3. Attendees were interested in learning more about the insurance options available through PhonePe. We're pleased that we were able to dispel their doubts and raise awareness about UPI as a safe and cost-effective means of transferring money.#phonepe #rbi #upi #awareness #workshop #learning"

1067,"🎉 Discover the Benefits and Types of React Hooks! 🚀As a frontend developer, I've been using React for a while now, and I can tell you that React hooks are a game-changer! 🙌Here are some benefits of using React hooks:👉 Simplified State Management: With hooks, you can manage state in functional components without the need for class components, making your code simpler and easier to read.👉 Improved Code Reusability: React hooks allow you to encapsulate logic that can be reused across components, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.Here are some types of React hooks and what they do:🔗 useState: Allows you to declare and update state variables in a functional component. Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0);🔗 useEffect: Allows you to manage side effects (e.g., API calls, DOM updates) in a functional component. Example: useEffect(() => { console.log('Hello, world!'); }, []);🔗 useContext: Allows you to access context values (e.g., user preferences, localization) in a functional component. Example: const { locale } = useContext(LocaleContext);🔗 useCallback: Allows you to memorize a function to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Example: const handleClick = useCallback(() => { console.log('Clicked!'); }, []);🔗 useMemo: Allows you to memorize a value to prevent unnecessary re-computations. Example: const result = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(), [dep1, dep2]);If you haven't tried React hooks yet, I highly recommend giving them a go. They can help you write better code and improve the performance of your React applications. 👍#React #ReactHooks #FrontendDevelopment #WebDevelopment #javascript #interview #internship"

1097,"It's been exactly 6 months since I moved to Canada 🇨🇦 permanently with my wife with our entire belongings packed in 4 suitcases. Here are the 6 lessons I learnt along the way:1. Like anything in life, your decision to immigrate should be based on what you want. Canada has its pros and cons. For me the pros like clean air, rule of law, good governance and higher level of social and work etiquette won over the insane cost of living and higher taxes.2. Surround yourself with positivity.  A lot of people will use their experience to scare you. But guess what, you are different. And times are different. Do not lose heart and stay focused on your goals.3. Keep an open and curious mind and you will learn everything eventually. For me it was learning how to drive here.4. Relationship matters. My wife is my biggest support and companion in this journey and made the transition almost a breeze. The friends we made here give the sense of security and belonging.5. Learn how to wash dishes, clean washrooms and segregate trash and you will stop hating the process 😛 6. Have patience and be resilient. Things ultimately improve 100% of time- you will have money in the account, a house in your name and a car in due time if you stick long enough.Pic is from our flight from Delhi to Vancouver on 14th Oct 2022."

The entire website was on WordPress, we did not spend much time on the UX or on the features.⭕ Why WordPress?▪️After my full-time job and youtube, there was hardly any time left for me to work on it. Leaving my job is not an option, as the ad revenue in India is super low. I was never in for selling courses, so there wasn't any constant recurring revenue source.▪️I did not outsource it, because of multiple reasons. One of the primary being outsourcing educational websites is risky unless you can give it time. You need to know how things work, just in case, things go ugly when it grows big. Most freelancers write highly readable codes ;)⭕ Future?This will be running on the side, as we don't have any plans to sell courses.

Name it, Elon Musk, Bernard, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Bill Gates, world’s wealthiest person, owns nothing of value except knowledge. Fighting to defend and extend the domain of their intellectual property is how they play the economic game. In addition, the world's major growth industries -such as microelectronics, biotechnology, designer-made materials, and telecommunications are brainpower industries. If their intellectual property can be copied easily, they will not be able to generate either wealth for their owners or high wages for their employees.Which is why, for the first time in history, the world’s wealthiest person is a knowledge worker. If you are betting on any other product than the knowledge, dear, you are doing it all wrong. “The world is changing” is the phrase long gone. Now, the leaders of the world are the person betting on their intellectual property. This urgent need has brought the need for more differentiated systems of determining who owns what, better protection for whatever is owned, and faster systems of dispute resolution. You see, if you are an intellectual person, I bet you’ll bet your all on #intellectualproperty . As these knowledge based industries are important in their own right, but they also enable other industries, in turn, to become knowledge based.

1125,"Menstruation continues to be a taboo subject in India due to which menstrual health takes a setback. Adoption of newer, more hygienic methods is still considerably low amongst adolescent women in rural India. To address this gap, Tarun Bothra created a first of its kind biodegradable sanitary napkins - Saathi Pads.These pads are 100% biodegradable, compostable, and are made from banana fibers which is highly absorbent and abundantly available in India. Unlike wood pulp or cotton, it is an agricultural by-product and does not require additional land usage.

1134,"‘You are quitting your job to rear donkeys? What a joke!! In the early 2000s, I had read about the benefits of donkey milk. It lingered in my memory and I felt compelled to carry out further research. “Goodknight” Mohan, who helped bring the “Goodknight” mosquito coil to the Indian household, was an inspiration. It was his unique invention that brought respite from mosquitoes of an entire nation. I wanted to do the same but in the cosmetics segment with a product that was innovative and effective. With this dream I took the plunge, quit my job in Bangalore and went back to Kerala. My friends and family were puzzled, to say the least, when I told them about the venture I was about to begin. ""Stick to your job!”, they said “You are the donkey!” they concluded. With time, awareness about the harmful effects of chemicals found in cosmetics grew, and people began switching to natural alternatives. Using the lemongrass extraction technique that my great grandfather gave our family and freeze-dried donkey milk, I developed Dolphin IBA’s first cosmeceutical cream. The journey wasn’t easy at all, it was far from it. I lost 22 of the 38 donkeys in a deadly wave of bacterial infection at the start. In addition to the backlash I faced from friends and family. Being in a business that worked with donkey milk wasn’t very appealing to them. They all warmed up to the idea once the products entered the market and received a warm reception. The benefits of donkey milk have proved to be highly advantageous in treating certain skin conditions like Psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions. ‘Who would’ve thought that donkey milk could be two times more effective than mainstream cosmetic products!’ Exclaim clients all the way from Dubai to Hollywood. - Aby Baby (Founder, Dolphin_iba)#KuchTohLogKahenge #InspirationBrew #FounderStories"
